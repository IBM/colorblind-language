green is green
Hope I’m not too late but can you draw a turtle eating a pickle? I think turtles and pickles are both green

I own 2 FSL sets and have always bought green for 2k, sorry.
Thank you, finally someone who agrees. So the green stains on my bed are fine right? /s
OP is one of the new AI that can green screen without a green screen.
Yes, the vast majority of actively publishing climate scientists – 97 percent – agree that humans are causing global warming and climate change.  — [American Association for the Advancement of Science](http://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/migrate/uploads/aaas_climate_statement.pdf)  — [American Chemical Society](https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/policy/publicpolicies/sustainability/globalclimatechange.html)  — [American Geophysical Union](http://sciencepolicy.agu.org/files/2013/07/AGU-Climate-Change-Position-Statement_August-2013.pdf)  — [American Meteorological Society](https://www.ametsoc.org/ams/index.cfm/about-ams/ams-statements/statements-of-the-ams-in-force/climate-change/) "The Geological Society of America (GSA) concurs with assessments by the National Academies of Science (2005), the National Research Council (2006), and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2007) that global climate has warmed and that human activities (mainly greenhouse‐gas emissions) account for most of the warming since the middle 1900s." — [The Geological Society of America](https://www.geosociety.org/gsa/positions/position10.aspx)  — [U.S. National Academy of Sciences](http://masgc.org/assets/uploads/publications/528/tna_cc.pdf)
Safe bet that he thinks scientists back in the good ol' days were trustworthy. Good him, that's true. As for the present, Fox News is a propaganda machine unlike anything on the left. They've been convincing viewers that *"billionaire George Soros"* and the *"green energy industrial complex"* are lobbying and paying *"bags and bags of money"* to corrupt scientists in labs and universities all around the world in order to falsify data to support the *"apocalyptic global warming narrative"* so that they can make bank on their *"solar panel schemes that everyone knows are doomed to failure, because what happens when the clouds come out? Uh-oh, no electricity for you. Green energy, they call it that because the money they're using to line the pockets of those so-called scientists is green."*
Introduced positive: Free exchange of science would lead to all levels of industry having access to cutting-edge and more efficient processes. Subtracted negative: Under capitalism, the dominant oil industry derails public transportation and other green initiatives.
It's not really green at all... Wrong sub. It was interesting though!
Get a 1200 watt LED grow light and blast a seed heater, I bet you can get some good seeds popped and toughened up in time for some late fall harvest action. Remember that greenhouse is gonna allow you to keep them later!
Right ever watch the avengers ? I just saw endgame because I loosely follow them but don't give a shit. The acting was terrible, you can tell they are just fucking around in front of a green screen. Its a bummer because some of the actors in it have a lot of talent but it just doesn't come through with a movie destined to sell well in China
Post reported as spam. Buying things is not green or sustainable.
"source third food sustainably" Impossible. Simply put. Macdiesels is the exact opposite of a sustainable food model. My guess is they are gonna replace 30% of the meat in their burgers with recyled cardboard. Making the big mac cheaper and more flavorfull. This is the most BS greenwashing I have ever seen.
Oh dude I grew up in a place where I was uncut but most people were circumcised. My health teacher in highschool when circumcision was brought up said plain and flat that circumcised penises were cleaner and she had her son cut. My friends and I were pretty open with each other and a few people looked over at me. Even when I was really little I asked my mom why my penis looked different and I was horrified to hear the answer at such a young age. I was super self conscious about it and I didn't lose my virginity until I was 18, and then all the chicks I got with seemed to love it or not care. Maybe two or three girls were a little taken aback at first but grew to like it or not care. I have also had to deal with an occasional yeast infection which is gross but really isn't that bad, haven't had one in years. The worst part was probably when I was fucking this chick and my frenulum which is a little tight ripped. (You can Google it if you want details) anyway I look down and there was some blood but I was drunk and didn't really feel it, I thought she was on the rag so we sorta just gave up and called it a night. The next morning when I went to take a piss it burned like hell fire. I went to the doctors long story short what didn't kill me made me stronger, it healed on it's own. I guess what I'm trying to say is that the grass is always greener, the catch is though, I love my foreskin it's my favorite part of my whole body, even though it can stir up some drama every now and again I would not trade it for anything. BUT if I wanted to I could go get snipped and see what it feels like. I have the choice. You my friend do not have the choice, and that sucks, and I'm sorry. That's why I'm so against circumcision, that and it is unnecessary, it's ugly, it's densensitiving and you are inflicting a terrible pain on a new born child at a time where you should be nurturing, protecting, and loving this defenseless being. You my friend have to play with the hand you were dealt, or in this case, the penis you were dealt. Use it wisely, it's like your signature, be careful where you stick it because it can get you into some pretty deep shit.
I The Owl and the Pussy-cat went to sea In a beautiful pea-green boat, They took some honey, and plenty of money, Wrapped up in a five-pound note. The Owl looked up to the stars above, And sang to a small guitar, "O lovely Pussy! O Pussy, my love, What a beautiful Pussy you are, You are, You are! What a beautiful Pussy you are!" II Pussy said to the Owl, "You elegant fowl! How charmingly sweet you sing! O let us be married! too long we have tarried: But what shall we do for a ring?" They sailed away, for a year and a day, To the land where the Bong-Tree grows And there in a wood a Piggy-wig stood With a ring at the end of his nose, His nose, His nose, With a ring at the end of his nose. III "Dear Pig, are you willing to sell for one shilling Your ring?" Said the Piggy, "I will." So they took it away, and were married next day By the Turkey who lives on the hill. They dined on mince, and slices of quince, Which they ate with a runcible spoon; And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand, They danced by the light of the moon, The moon, The moon, They danced by the light of the moon.
Stony iron meteorites are awesome, even little ones are like 30 dollarS, and I am talking under a gram , and they are extremely dense, but not as dense as other types of meteorites. At this point I'm just rambling, but did you know they have not confirmed if the greenish glassier mineral on this meteorite was formed in space, or during it's collision with earth... I love meteorites, that should really be my username. Can I change my username and keep my karma??
electric cars are really greenwashed. Those batteries are highly toxic, and can not be disposed of easily. Its very optimistic and trendy to think we will create sustainable societies. In reality we will deplete the worlds resources and then try and do damage control. Food prices will continue to go up to as population increases. The wealthy will control a higher percentage of the worlds resources while population levels off, and the poor will perish.

Funny smelling cigarettes? are they green inside?
So I'm on Timeline#6 currently, havent yet got to Titan. The "population" text on Earth and Moon and some of the fortunes that have a green background are pretty hard to see. The settings could use a darker outline also, they aren't as hard to read as the others though. Will update once I'm back to Mars/Jupiter and Titan.
Pineapple, pepperoni and green olives on pizza. The sweet and salty is just so damn good!
Building a greenhouse is much cheaper, and easier than you'd imagine. Keeps in the smell, is good for colder climates, and can be built with tinted film and then no one can see in. It just needs a little watering, though. I have one for legal plants, but I'm sure I could grow a plant or two and no one would notice. My old place was deep in the mountains, so I had no issue back then. Little more urban now.
That's true. You can only cross the green line if the space is vacant, that meaning, you can't capture over a green line.
Oh great, now it's even harder to filter out the green apple ones.
No. Obama's order stopped the processing of refugee applications only. It didn't stop folks from visiting on visas or green cards. And only from Iraq, which is where the two Al-Qaeda refugees originated. Trump's order was for more countries, included folks who would otherwise be able to travel legitimately (I think he's backed that off now though), and was not in response to any specific event. "Trump came up with his Muslim ban following the Orlando nightclub shooting, an attack committed not by refugees or migrants, but by a US citizen who was born in New York." ([source](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/no-barack-obama-jimmy-carter-9717520))  Except none of the countries have had a terrorist originate from them. If you're going to argue that, you need to include Saudi Arabia and others on the ban list as well.  These are mostly countries that consider themselves actively at war with the Israeli state over Gaza. And the Israel-Palestine conflict has been a hot issue for decades, so you can't say there's no outrage about it.  Possibly, but it also gains a fair bit of outrage just on the stuff contained therein. An "unfair amount"? No. The administration has not been the slightest bit empathetic, even going out of its way to childishly insult anyone who disagrees with it.
He's not going to be Maryland's governor forever, and assuming he remains cancer free he's probably going to want to move on to something bigger afterwards. I would find him an acceptable presidential candidate myself, and I'm definitely not a Republican. However, by not backing the party's nominee, he may have limited his options down the road. He may not want to disassociate himself from his party, but there's a chance that they disassociate themselves from him. If I were left high and dry like that, I would definitely move on for greener pastures.
Hershel's leg is not a good example to show that they could easily throw in the amputation of Rick's hand. They found creative ways to get avoid the use of green screen, such as draping pants beyond the stump, giving him a prosthesis, etc. A hand will be exponentially more difficult and expensive. I wonder if the same thing happening to a character in another major TV show that comes on right after TWD's season ends held any sway over their decision.
In most areas (EDIT: in the US), diesel uses green nozzles.
It looked to me like the camera realized what happened, then looked at the light in the intersection to check if it was green or not, almost as if that was relevant to what it just saw. Kinda creepy.

This is why as a Canadian citizen that has a green card and lives in Chicago, I stay out of the Bible thumper states as much as I can.
Cover Jason's whole body with the gooie green stuff
I got banned from r/racism just for commenting on a r/greentext post
I always come to the conclusion that green screens are used in this situations, but I'm never fully satisfied. There's something we don't know!!!!
Not just the green ones, but the little ones too
Ooh, I have an idea. In the latest green screen one, there's a part where Ian opens the window and acts like he is seeing a tragedy: Can you put the clip where Jack points out that his channel name has "TV" in it.?
Fuck off vogel for keeping green
Lmao this guy tried his best to make the AD trade look lopsided in favor of the Pelicans. I bet he wishes it was the green team that traded for him.
You mean like it has a green check mark and says it's been imported, right? It's the only world state I imported. I did all that, it's just it didn't say what I had called it when I started up the game. Like, so far Varric hasn't really spoken of Hawke or Anders so I can't do the easy check of "Okay, is my Hawke still a female and is Anders dead?" The one thing that supported my world state was the Requisition Officer mentioning that Anora was queen when talking about Loghain. Not sure if that means Alistair isn't around (he's dead in my world state).
I was making a joke about your typo. But while we're on the topic, once you're out of the relationship, you're going to miss it. Grass is always greener blah blah.
I was playing I Spy with my sister and my mom, when I was 7. I swear that garbage bin looked green.
Legendary and Common / Epic and Rare look identical without close inspection of the details. I've looted many common (green) items thinking they were legendary when there is a legendary on the ground near by.

Chicken and green beans, chicken and green beans, chicken and green beans. We'd buy a bunch, cook them, freeze them, and I take them to work. Dinners are similar but with a wider variety of meats and vegetables plus cheese. We don't really do anything fancy and we never try to make mock foods. I stopped tracking my food pretty early on and just kept a mental log of carbs so I can't really comment on calories, but I do imagine half of the diet's effect comes from lack of food availability leading to general lack of calories
I definitely look both ways before going at a green light after browsing that sub frequently.
Buy a private jet and take her to northern greenland.
Sorry about the artifacts I just now noticed, I don't know what went wrong. I tried to make this again without re sizing it but that green line is still there. I hope it doesn't happen again if I make more gifs from this file.
I realize that but when it gets to the higher tier ships you'd think they'd be rolling in enough cash money green to have their own ship.
The green card was fuzzy, so I put down fuzz.
You mean something like lipton green tea? I could drink a ton of those, you think that'd be bad for me?
Cash, money, green.
I definitely have that, but sometimes things get crazy. One time I got home from Iron man 3 and it was kind of dark inside. As I was taking my shoes off, an outer corner of the walls began to send out green pulses. I looked at it from different angles for about half a minute until I didn't notice it before. Closed eye visuels are crazy too. They're very dim, and very fuzzy, but there's not a doubt in my mind these aren't just thought images or anything. I'll lay down at night watching random geometric shapes and images fade into eachother. The most animated and visual one looked something like these http://assets.windows8wallpaper.us/2011/09/22/2115/65656/960x600/psychedelic-960x600.jpg http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQRrNWxZQeEVwufjOONipHa4aDWK_hcJy59mxxej3hkKSCzEwEf http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQaasihYP3glDrde60FTpDQPn9yk42B4DCVQ-e9kgdaXmmRT1Ceag only it was a lot more... inconsistent.

I was having my pignigga farming trees when one of the trees killed him. After trying to avoid the tree dude for a couple days I found out he's not agro. Worried that he might kill the pignigga when he respawns I decided to lead him into bait him into the swamp so he would farm tentacle spikes and hopefully die. And then, well, yeah. EDIT: WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT THING IN THE PANIC PICTURE
Fuck you it's green. upbaots
I thought it was green. I'm colorblind, I demand to know the truth.
If you're saying voting in general is not enough, yes that is correct. Everyone really should do it though because it adds some legitimacy to the "other" actions that need to happen. If you're saying the Green party is part of the "masters" then I'm sorry to inform you that's not the case. It's hard enough to get a minority voice heard without splitting between the green and the populists.
It's not uncommon for Sriracha mayo to include some lime juice to thin it out. And I'm not saying Greek yogurt dressings aren't uncommon, it's literally the same concept as mayo-based dressings, like ranch. I'm just saying I would never toss greens in Sriracha mayo, or yogurt. Ranch is pretty gross when you think about it, but it has seasonings to make up for it. This dressing's only seasoning is Sriracha.
I'm a big fan of the "green eggs and ham" special from a while back.
You mean green onions right? Cause cooking with chives as part of the base would get expensive real quick.
Similarly, Hillary lost Ohio and Florida by less votes than Republicans got in those states. If the people who voted Donald Trump had switched to Hillary, WE WOULD NOT HAVE Trump. We also would have one less rapist on the Supreme Court. Worth it tho right??? tboy those guys prove their point, really showed everybody. Trump or die, literally.  I'm saying this all because you can't expect people to sacrifice their voting principles for the sake of unity behind a candidate who people have legitimate reasons not to be elected. I don't know why liberals expect unity but only with their candidates. It is the job of the candidate to earn the votes, ideally through policy proposals. Hillary didn't earn those votes, presumably because those who voted green care about fighting climate change which Hillary had no good plan for. If Biden wants to earn any of those votes, he needs to come up with a better proposal than "not Trump."
Non shitty answer real quick: Head on down to /r/colorblind for a fun time with this picture. I'm still pretty convinced that the bag is green and anyone who says otherwise is just trying to fuck with me.
Yes but the fact that there was a ban on legal immigration for no real reason other than politics is important. If you had a green card, but were from one of those countries, you better not leave because you're not coming back. The fact that a ban was drawn up at all provides uncertainty with immigration. Politics aside, because of the ban, immigration services have been severely bogged down with cases they have to sort out, meaning if there is any problem at all with visas, it'll be even harder to sort out.
On the other end of the spectrum, if you're behind me honking the moment the light turns green, or sometimes before it even turns green, you can bet your ass I'll take my time turning.
Strange, I normally use ults more offensively, catching people out or splitting the enemy, is that still good? Also what do you think of the idea of running first blood mastery + green father's gift and doing a level 1 cheese? I've found I can get a solo first blood on enemy adc early or force summs, but that's just my experience.
It's probably a lot of "the grass is always greener". We're not getting either of those. It's a huge confidence boost whenever I get hit on, and I definitely see it as a real compliment since it happens so rarely. I've also noticed a lot of compliments from other females, which I also think counts. Like, I don't really care if it's a guy or girl that compliments me, it's a compliment nonetheless!
It changed? There are no Greenlandic flag in /r/europe and I use the Danish one here. I use the Greenlandic flag in /r/Denmark and I am a CSS mod in /r/greenland. If you doubting me, go through my profile, and you will find tons of times were I said I am Greenlandic. If you mean the comment on my flag flair, I had to explain so many times I am Greenlandic living in Denmark, I simply just changed it so I can use less time to explain. ^^^But ^^^ignore ^^^all ^^^the ^^^comments ^^^I ^^^made ^^^on ^^^NSFW ^^^subs, ^^^please.
Again, have people not heard of "the devil's advocate?" He didn't "BTFO" Dansken, Dansken said arguments that a person from the opposite political spectrum would make to bring out Rosling's arguments more. I'm not a dane who is butthurt, I'm a greenlander who views it from an objective perspective.
Many greenlanders are feeling guilt, sorrow, and solidarity with Iceland. With news of both Birna and the murder of the 20 year old in Skagen, it is indeed a difficult time in greenland emotinally. But we will both get through it.
Using this theme in /r/greenland. Thanks.
Only few danes learn greenlandic since danish is the lingua franca in greenland. I know one ethnically dane who knows Greenlandic, but only because her family studies inuit culture, and runs an inuit museum. She grew up in Greenland, but other danes, even though they also grew up in Greenland, don't bother to learn it.
I recently moved to Denmark for education, anyone who wants a higher education than highschool has to go to denmark to study. But I think I'll return once the education is over(3-5 years?). Denmark is flat as fuck. The internet service in greenland is shit. Too slow and too expensive. That because Tele Greenland has monopoly on Internet in Greenland, as no other company wants to invest in a remote place with few people.
Not a grassroot, but political parties, Demokraatit(The democrats), and Inuit Ataqatsigiit(United Inuit). Denmark handles all foreign affairs, so greenland has to go through Denmark for everything, that includes contact with other inuit in Canada or Alaska, which is a bummer, and those parties has been strong advocates for closer relation with Iqaluit, the canadian inuit capital town.
There's no series of any kind, but there have been a handful of movies, but I don't think you can stream them. They are sold in DVDs, or are circulating around Greenland as ripped videos from said DVDs. If you find a way, then I'd recommend Qaqqat Alanngui, and Qaamarngup uummataa. Other than that, there are few youtube videos, and KNR puts up news from greenland on youtube.
There's plenty enough speakers to survive, but the question is how much of it will be loanwords as oppose to greenlandic words. Will it be like English, where it is a Germanic language, but most words have latin origin, or will it retain much of it's own words? Currently, I'd say there are more greenlandic words than loanwords, but I don't know if it could change. We also have plenty of books, but they are mostly in book-book form, rather than digital.
Kinda hard to explain what "kutattoq" is to an non-greenlander, but imagine a baby who struggles say the letter "V", but instead says the letter "B". That's common in babies, and in few months or years, they learn to pronounce the letter "V". Tunumiusut, to an west-greenlander, sounds like someone who hasn't learned to do that, but instead of V and B, it is with whole words and phrases. They say Ittoqqotoormiit instead of illoqqotoormiut. It sounds like they can't pronounce L, and U. It's a different language, they speak different, but to the ears of an kalaaleq(west-greenlander), it's sounds like a baby.
Basically names for technology are loanwords, cellphones/smartphones are called "mobiili"(from danish "mobil"), Ipad-ti, tableti. But a PC is called either Kompiuuteri, or Qarasaasiaq(lit.: "Brain-storage"). Then there's business/workplace names, Banki is bank, fabrikki(from danish fabrik) is factory, but office is allaffik(lit.: place to write). It's kinda 50/50 whether or not there is a greenlandic name for workplaces. The question about scandinavian languages, many greenlanders have danish as second language, and some of them as mother-language, so we're able to know if the scandinavian being spoken is danish or not, but we still can't differentiate between Norwegian and Swedish, since both are more high-pitched, and sounds like they are singing instead of speaking.
Kujataani Ilinniarnertuungorniarfik(the south highschool) is the word I like the best, since it is a long-ass word and because of that, danes don't usually believe it is a word when I tell them I studied there. Also, it literally means "place to become highly educated in the south". the south being south-greenland.
There's was a dane, who unfortunately recently passed, that lived many years in Narsaq with his family, and had learned Greenlandic quite a lot. His wife runs the inuit museum in Narsaq. Their child, even though she is 100% dane, can speak Greenlandic, because she grew up in Narsaq. ~~The tumblr user is greenlandic, it seems, so the resource is pretty reliable.~~ Huh, seems like the person is just really well informed on Greenlandic language.
Hey, I found https://oqaasileriffik.gl/en/ while I was browsing greenlandic education sites.
Qallunaat - Danes, originally meant foreigner, but danes were the dominant foreigners, they just took over the meaning. Now foreigners translates to "Nuna allamioq"(lit. from other land). I think I'll add other words that might come into mind later, but this seems like a word that doesn't get mentioned when greenlandic is discussed. singular: Kutattoq, plural: Kutattut. It's a word for describing childish speak. Restroom is Anartarfik(lit.: place to excremate) Bathroom is Uffarfik(lit.: place to take a bath) Bedroom is Sinittarfik(lit.: place to sleep) -fik is used to indicate place to do something. another example a store is Pisiffik(lit.: place to buy) Room is Ini. also, livingroom is Ineeraq(lit.:small room) Computer translates to Qarasaasiaq, but everyone has started to just call it kompiuuteri, loanword from danish komputer.
East-greenlandic speakers gets bullied in school on how they sound "childish"(Kutattut), so that's a problem I would like to see solved. They get bullied because the way they speak resembles baby-greenlandic. They are also more uncontaminated greenlandic, where they use fewer loanwords from danish or english. I can understand about 70% of what they're saying. North-Greenlandic is difficult, since it is closer to Inuktitut, than Greenlandic, and I can't for the life of me, understand Inuktun and inuktitut, I can probably understand 40% of what they say. But if they say the words slowly, one by one, I can understand them.
Around 85% of the population of Greenland is Greenlandic, and most of them speak Greenlandic, but split up in West-Greenlandic(Kalaallisut), East-Greenlandic, which is it's own language(Tunumiusut), North-Greenlandic(Avannarmiusut, but they prefer to call it Inuktun). Kalaallisut has two dialects, U-dialect, and I-dialect. I speak the U-dialect. Then there are also 15000 greenlanders living in Denmark, but many children grew up in danish speaking environment, so younger generation are danish speaker, while older generations are native greenlandic speakers.
That's what I mean, he says it is inuktitut, but it is greenlandic. In inuktitut, Ainnga is used as a greeting, but in greenlandic, it is used to indicate something is there, not as a greeting.
Funny thing is, more danes are on average, likely to be alcoholics than Greenlandic. This happens because danes are more likely to recognize greenlanders as greenlandic when they are holding a beverage, but more likely to think they are asian if they are not. ~~That's racist.~~
Also explains Niels Bohr. You'd have to be a genius to know the danish counting system. And before you assume me being dane, I'm greenlandic living in denmark, and I am as confused as all other nordics.
Running on 100% green energy.
I personally feel like Iceland, Faroe Islands and Greenland has a different bond, different from what I see between Nordic countries. We have many so families that have married into each countries that we have basically made 'new minorities', so Half-greenlandic-Half-Icelandic and Half-Greenlandic-Half-Faroes populations are quite large in South-Greenland, and I am fortunate enough to know many of them. Most of Half-Icelanders are in Farming business, while most Half-Faroes are Fisher-men. Am I not right in thinking that it is the same with Iceland?
Interesting. But would it not make more sense to build a westgreenlandic-style qajaq to match the paddle?

It has been done before. There was a Japanese woman that dogsled from north-greenland to south-greenland, but that was many years ago. Then there is also the Sirius Patrol, where danish soldiers dogsleds around the national park.
what? are you trying to write greenlandic, or are you mocking us?
Claim to be a scientist that have found an alternative energysource, easily produceable, cheap, and very green, when in fact it is poisonous gas that will consume the whole world. And they live happily ever after. THE END
~~God's~~ your boss farts *ARE* the cause of Climate Change. lol but seriously, In greenland's icecap, the newest layer of ice contains more pollution than all the ice layers created more than 150 years ago *COMBINED*. So it proves that since humans started running on fossil fuel, that the the climate have drastically have been changing. Ice is the "almost" perfect diary of the worlds climate. "almost" because it can melt and the data it holds will be gone forever.
Are u assuming that I’m not green?
I never thought about it but that looks a lot like the Spotify logo 😱. You should’ve made it green.
I replied to a guy lower down who needed some education on how colorblindness worked and I noted that the green crosses practically blend in the the background making them easy to ignore. Maybe the creator of this infographic is a protan and they liked that it blended in. Who knows, works for us.
Fuck...I'm colorblind and I thought there was only one green.
"Ever since I started breaking out 2 years ago until now (I hardly have a legitimate pimple these days. Yay!) I would get this weird pimples on certain parts of my face. Usually my cheekbone to temple area on my left side and the apple of my right cheek. I would best describe them as white spots. They do not come to a head nor are they red or inflammed. They are sometimes every so slightly raised. I have to look closely to see one. Prior to landing on my current, very effective routine, I would get atleast one a month. I think my current routine as really minimized them because I rarely find one. Here's the thing, since they don't come to a head they can't be lanced. If I wanted to get one out I have to basically ""open"" it by using an extractor to try to pop it. Somtimes I do get some white gunk out, sometimes not. Either way, I can tell it's opened because I can see a small red hole. Then I apply HCB's and MAN, does a lot of stuff come out. I'm talking up to several nights of HCB's until it's drained. If I was able to push out puss the first time, I often end up pushing out more a day or two later. It's like these spots have no major outwardly signs, but they must be quite deep. Once one goes away another doesn't come back in the same spot. Like I said, ever since landing on my current routine they have really, really decreased. I'm not sure which product they responded to. My routine: AM: * wash with Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser (btw I cannot say enough good things about this. It even removes make up!) * apply Neutrogena 2% salicylic acid toner * apply Olay 7-in-1 Total Effects moisturizer PM: * cleanse with same Cetaphil cleanser * apply Alpha Hydrox 10% AHA lotion * apply Aczone * moisturize with Cetaphil moisturizing cream This has been my routine since the winter, with just the AHA being added in June.  So I guess my two questions are: What are these these? Which of my products helped get rid of them and is there anything else I can use to 100% eliminate them? I'd say there's an 80-90% decrease in them."
"Half that shit can be found in the cities. Especially Magpies (the dive bombing birds). I live 30km out of Melbourne city and have red back spiders in my shed, and snakes in my backyard. Port Philip Bay has jelly fish and blue ringed octopuses. Crocodiles can be found in Cairns, and ""stinger"" jellyfish too. Sydney isn't safe either. Funnel Web Spiders are quite common.

"I think the thing that is concerning is not so much his past as it is the fact that he only wanted to change after meeting you and you guys are really still in the honeymoon phase and this could possibly be a non-permanent change. I would def be wary, but on the other hand, my partner is an example of an alcoholic BD who was trying his best to be a dad but was mentally and emotionally abused for years and could not stand up to BM until I helped him work through all the messed up things in his head (if you try to get more custody youre taking him from his mom and he needs her, if you don't pay his moms bills you dont love him and no he cant just stay with you and be provided for by you because thats not his home, if you don't stay with his mom your failing him as a father it doesnt matter if she hits you be a tough man things like that) after we got to untangle that web he got back in court we got 50/50 and he has been a stellar father who upholds firm but kind boundaries with the HCBM and has been consistently working to improve himself as a person (stopped drinking entirely, stopped smoking, learning to code vs being unskilled, actively working on being more in tune with his own emotions and being a gentle father) so it def is possible that maybe he was kinda a loser dad before who was just an ATM for the kids and their moms and now he is going to become a better person but these are still yellow-red flags that you need to keep in the back of your mind in case other things crop up"
"That's fair - and I thought about throwing in the [seal of the State of Texas](http://mewarnai.us/images/237651-texas-state-seal.gif) to my original post for reference, since it's clearly the reason that so many Texas schools have adopted the motif. You simply don't don't see the nautical star used as much in other states.

"The thing about color correcting is that the color of the product you use should match the intensity of the area you want to conceal. So for instance if you have extreme dark undereye circles, Becca's Papaya would be a better color choice because it is a deeply pigmented red. [Picture for reference](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiS7LGV3NrLAhWOth4KHXNCBsIQjRwIBw&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwild4makeup.com%2F2015%2F11%2F27%2Fbecca-cosmetics-backlight-targeted-colour-correctors%2F&amp;psig=AFQjCNF7Wnhj_IxA5ErpwTXohGak_CA3jw&amp;ust=1458956829318166). On the other hand, if you have sort of dark undereye circles but not too bad, a sheer peach shade would do just as fine such as the [YSL Color Corrector in Bisque](http://www.sephora.com/touche-eclat-neutralizers-P404768?skuId=1777606). I hope this makes sense. I don't have redness so idk about specific products, but if you do not like that Sephora concealer I recommend returning it and swatching the new Becca correctors as those seem to be the most pigmented ones on the market right now. MUFE also has a color correcting/concealer palette for different skintones and the product has excellent pigmentation. But yeah, if you were unsatisfied with the Sephora concealer or deal with redness on the regular I rec a new product! However tbh I think your base looks fine, being 100% flawless-looking is too unnatural imo. :P"
"Whether protons decay or not, the end result is pretty much the same. It will take longer, but everything eventually ends up as a bunch of stray low-energy photons and lonely cold subatomic particles. Over obscenely, incomprehensibly long time spans, quantum tunneling can have extreme macroscopic effects. Eventually all the stars burn out and we're left with black holes and stellar remnants. The stellar remnants like white dwarfs should will slowly cool to the temperature of their surroundings. Still, not even these dead stellar corpses are eternal. Eventually they end up as iron stars. Iron is the most energetically favorable nucleus, and eventually quantum-tunneling induced fusion will drag everything to iron. The universe is not old enough for even a single iron star to form, but given long enough time scales, it's what should happen. But even these iron stars are not eternal. What's the minimum mass needed for a black hole that can be stable long enough to increase in mass before it evaporates? Pretty large. But eventually, there is a certain probability that enough iron atoms in an iron star will tunnel into a dense enough configuration to form such a singularity. At such point, it will consume and absorb its stellar remnant. So, in this way, eventually everything ends up as a black hole. Stray atoms of hydrogen gas will drift until they eventually hit a black hole. So, in the end all that is left are black holes. Of course, not even these great survivors are eternal. The black holes themselves evaporate due to Hawking radiation, and release all their mass as miniscule amounts of quantum jetsam. Pretty much nothing is left in the universe except photons red-shifted to the temperature of the CBM, and a few stray neutrinos and random single protons separated by parsecs."

"“Conform” seems to strong a word here. If we’re looking for explanations of how things work, being able to rule out a scifi explanation makes for a very different analysis than if those explanations *cannot* be ruled out.

"“Faceless Men” gets like 9 hits searching the entire written works, comprising 2 conversations outside of Arya’s actual time with Jaqen and at the House of Black and White. Even the FM killing Balon and Pate is very subtle. And yet look at what an outsized position they hold in the imaginations of the fandom. However, the show has made the FM much more prominent merely by virtue of putting them on screen. Arya’s face-swapping shenanigans is the sort of thing that really catches the attention. My little brother has been asking when “that badass dude with the white and red hair” will be back for years, going so far as to call him his favourite character after he appears in what...4 episodes? There’s a reason that GRRM cut Tyrion’s explicit meeting with the Shrouded Lord: magic is like truffle oil, as a little goes a long way, but too much overpowers. The Faceless Men’s involvement in the story is subtle but significant. Their abilities make even a fleeting glimpse speak volumes, and we’ve seen much more than mere fleeting glimpses. With the power of the Faceless Men, Arya exterminated the entire male line of House Frey in the show. She was confident she could casually wander into King’s Landing to murder Cersei. Think of what more experienced FM could do if they were politically motivated? It’s the case of Chekhov’s Identity-Stealing Assassins. There is just no way they’re not more involved in the end game. The only questions are how, why, and when."
"“It's a consequence of being around women irl and hearing first hand what they find attractive.” So they don’t find anyone but superhero actors attractive? Won’t date anyone except superhero actors? That seems a strategy that is doomed. “The difference is twofold: One one hand, the hottest female celebs don't look that different from your average tween - just put some fancy clothing and expensive make-up on Jane who lives next door and she's ready for the red carpet.” If you think neighborhood tweens look like adult actresses...I guess I don’t know what to say to you, dude. “On the other hand, male celebs have a combination or rare features that your average man doesn't posess. Joe won't pass for Henry Cavill even in an Armani suit. The second is that a large number of men search for porn involving obese women over 40 even though Scarjo nudes exist. Assuming you're anywhere in between that, you can get the same level of attraction she gets, just from fewer men. Meanwhile a lot of guys will never experience getting tweens looking at Aquaman topless levels of attraction.” Heh, I’ll remember this comment the next time an incel tells me that any and every woman over age 25 has “hit the wall” and is now undateable. And I just don’t think you understand human attraction very well. Lots of people are in happy relationships, and would choose their partners over Aquaman or the Black Widow every time."
"“Non-spectral” refers to colors that require the combination of two or more distinct wavelengths of visible light. Purple, for example, requires red and blue wavelengths. It is not a color that can be found on the visible spectrum. Same goes for brown and pink."
"“Obviously there is nothing wrong with being late at losing your virginity, however it will come up as a red flag and increase your struggles if you lack experience and are 10 years late compared to the normal person.” Ten years late? Do you think this guy should have sought to lose his virginity at age ten? Do you think that’s when “normal” people have sex. (It’s not.). He’s 20, he’s perfectly fine. Who’s going to think this is a red flag? And a red flag for what, exactly? “20%, so if you graduate college without having sex then you are in the bottom 20%, no one wants to be in the bottom 20%.” How do you figure it’s the “bottom”? We’re not being graded here. By your logic, that means the small percentage of people who have sex at ages 13-14 are also at the “bottom.” There is no best and worst here, no right and wrong. They’re just numbers, and there is nothing unusual about where OP is at."

"“Please, please don’t!” the girl pled. “And who might you be?” the uninterested Reaper asked. “I’m Poopoo’s roommate. Please don’t take him away from me!” She began sobbing. The Reaper glanced at her, and swiftly looked her up on his tablet. “Let’s see. Weewee Poomasters. Huh, you’ve got a weird name. You’re his roommate but for some reason unknown, you share a surname with him.” He held down his tablet for a moment, and looked into her teary eyes, “and you ask me to spare your roommate. Why should I?” “He’s the only person I know since I moved here. He’s my only friend in this world. You mustn’t take him away from me!” The Reaper sighed, “everyone eventually meets their end, and now is the time for his. I do not spare due souls easily. I am going to need more than that.” “Oh,” she hesitated, “well… he’s my best friend. I mean, he was, until he pranked me with his hand buzzer, and put sulphur in the sauna.” “Sounds like a troublemaker to me.” The Reaper once again swiped on his table. “No, wait! He… cooks real nice meals and can fix electronics! He’s a good mixologist too!” “No, that’s no good reason. I don’t think he can fix electronics either way.” “How about this?” She reached into her pocket and plucked out a dull, greyish flower. “There, I give you this in exchange for his soul.” The Reaper took the flower, held it before his eyes and examined it closely. He hesitated and took a deep breath. “Sorry luv,” the Reaper said, “sadly this is just some dead flower. Not what it takes to spare a soul.” Then, he made a few strokes on his tablet. An ethereal light whooshed out of the corpse. He timely pulled out his scythe and voila, Poopoo’s soul was trapped and reaped. His work done, the Reaper put his tablet back in his pocket. Then suddenly she spoke. “Hey Death,” she presented her most pleasant smile, “I’m Weewee. How’s your day?” “Huh?” the Reaper was rather taken aback with her sudden change in mood, “Umm, I’m fine, I guess?” “Wow, I must compliment your outfit. You look *marvellous*!” She exclaimed. Odd though it might feel, the Reaper politely smiled, “why thank you. You’re the first one in years to have appreciated my black cloak.” “You’re welcome! Let me brighten your day…” //  “You *WHAT*?” the Doctor cried, “did you really?”. Death scratched his head in embarrassment. “… In one afternoon.” “You fell in love with her!? After a whole afternoon of chatting and flirting, and you’ve found yourself a *mortal* girlfriend? Wow.” The Doctor shook her head in amazement, trying to conceal her laughter. She giggled. Then she burst into laughter. “Oh god, never thought you’re an easy guy. What, did she find your skeleton sexy or something?” “Look, she was persuasive, okay?” He protested, “I have never experienced love. Sure, my twin sister always does Jupiter’s follow-up work, but I am a terrifying spectre, Doctor. No one had loved me before. I’m a noob in love, Doc!” He added, “by the way, I do have a human form with flesh, not just the skeleton. It just happened that I was so on that day.” “Congratulations on finding your first love. Jupiter must've cocked up so badly.” She made more scribbles, and drew a heart between his name and hers. “Is that why you’re traumatized?” “No, Doctor, there’s more to come. Let me finish. So after that day, we frequently texted and often she’d call me. Then one day her another roommate, who had moved in for merely 2 hours, drowned in a fenced-up pool. I went to her place once again.” “That’s suspicious, considering how her new roommate died so soon. I’m not trying to pry but… did she kill her new roommate?” “No,” Death replied, “I would know it otherwise. My tablet would show ‘homicide’ instead of ‘accidental death’. Having said that, something else wasn’t right about this death.” The Doctor raised her eyebrows. “How so?” “The roommate’s date of death was earlier than it should’ve been. Not sure if my tablet changed it. And the last time I checked, Weewee didn’t have a fenced-up pool.” “Anyway,” the Reaper continued, “I went to her place, and this time she didn’t even plead for her roommate. Instead she waited for me to finish reaping his soul, and went straight on flirting with me!” At that point the Reaper felt the embarrassment creeping up on him. “Like last time, she was really persuasive. On that day, she asked me to move in with her and…” “And…?” “I stayed the night, and…” “Wow,” the Doctor was truly shocked. “First you got yourself a girlfriend in a day’s time, then the second time you saw her you moved in with her and lost your virginity!” “Stop laughing at me! I’m traumatized!” “All right,” the Doctor held back her tease, “I assume immortal spirits still require protection during… that… with a mortal.” “Yeah about that…” At this point the Reaper was very embarrassed indeed. A slight, weak red glow shone beneath his hood. “Oh please tell me you did.” “I… didn’t. And… she had it. I knew it immediately.” “How?” “I saw two glowing diamond thingy floating in mid-air!” the Reaper cried, “that diamond thingy’s been above her all day when I saw her last time.” The Doctor gasped. She realized what had been going on. She kept herself calm and explained, “that’s a plumbob. It’s something… unique to a very kind of human. You can google it up later. Anyhow, please go on.” “I then realized I made a very horrible mistake. I'm never supposed to do what my twin sister does. We sometimes meet, but never cross streams in work.” The Doctor asked, “did you try to persuade her to have an abortion? You’re the Reaper after all. That still counts as soul reaping, doesn’t it?” “It wasn’t due to die yet.” The Reaper sighed, “there was no talking into her. She seemed possessed with the baby. She even bought a pram and toys and everything! Oh jeez, I couldn’t imagine what a semi-mortal being would be like.” “So what happened to the baby?” //  “OW!” Weewee screamed as she struggled on the bed. A puddle of water soaked the bedsheet and blankets. Appearing out of nowhere, the Reaper came to her. “Oh dear me. It’s happening.” From the porch crept in a white angel-like spirit. “And now I shall br- *WHY THE F*** ARE YOU HERE BRO?*” It was Death’s twin sister, Life. “KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN!” Death panicked, “I made a terrible mistake, okay?” “BUT WHY? FOR SO MANY MISTAKES YOU COULD’VE MADE, WHY THIS?” Life went hysterical as she cringed and clutched her head between her fists. “ARE YOU A NOOB TO YOUR JOB?” “I *KNOW* WHAT I’M DOIN’!” Death tried to defend himself. Life shrieked, “WELL IS THAT SO? WHAT AM I SEEING HERE, HUH? TRYIN’ TO TAKE OVER MY JOB, I SEE? OF BRINGING LIFE TO THIS VERY WORLD? TRYING TO GET YOUR SIS SACKED FROM HER JOB, INNIT?” “SHE FELL IN LOVE WITH ME *FIRST*,” Death yelled, “if you’ve got a problem with that then take your s*** to Jupiter.” “Oh,” Life said, “no wonder why he said he screwed up too.” “DOES ANYONE CARE ABOUT MY EXPLODING UTERUS?” Weewee cried. “So…” Death continued, “are you gonna help me, sis?” Life backed off, “HELL NO, BRO! I might be in charge of bringing life to this world, but I’m not taking liability for your cock up. I’ve never brought a supernatural, semi-mortal thing to life, and I don’t intend to do that any time sooner. You’re so screwed up, bro. You’re on your own. See ya!” “No wait-” And just like that Life disappeared with a blink. “I’ve to do this myself then. Go on, Weewee!” “Huh? You want me to-” she seemed confused. “No I don’t want you to urinate on your bed, will you please give birth to the half-spirit baby now!?” Weewee painfully nodded. She held her tears, and pushed. He could see the baby’s head. “Oh this is not what I’m here for…” the Reaper muttered. She pushed again. This time more of the baby could be seen, but less mortal it appeared. “Oh this is not my job, this is exactly the opposite of my job!” She pushed again. The thing was halfway out. “OH THIS IS SO NOT MY JOB! OH LIFE PLEASE COME AND HELP ME! I’LL BUY YOU THAT CAKE YOU’VE ALWAYS WANTED OH FOR GOODNESS SAKE PLEASE COME AND HELP ME OUT THIS IS SO NOT MY JOB-” //  “And thus, Uglything Poomasters was born,” the Reaper said, “and that, doctor, is why I’m traumatized, I think. Please help me.” “Ugh… Let’s… see… It would… seem… to require more than just… excuse me!” the Doctor stood up and tiptoed towards the door, cringing. But then she immediately turned back and reached into her bookshelf. She took out a weird-looking book, still cringing. “Oh, I really need to- Well let’s… see. From… your description, I believe that the Poomasters are the recently-” suddenly she flailed her right hand in the air, and held her left hand at her crotch and cried “HEY I REALLY NEED TO-”, but then she calmed down, “… the Poomasters are the recently introduced… members of Oasis Springs, am I correct?” “Doctor Coddle, are you all right?” the Reaper asked, “your diamond glowing thing has turned red.” “I’m fine. This is fine!” Doctor Coddle sternly replied, “now to go on, I think they belong to a special kind of men, to which I also belong. They’re called the Sims- OH CRAP!!!” Suddenly, the Doctor stood up and screamed “OH CRAP OH CRAP OH CRAP!” as she wet herself, staining her white coat and leaving a stinking puddle on the office floor. “Oh for goodness sake! What have I done! Why did I not… OH NO!” she shrieked and began crying. Her plumbob has turned yellow. “Uhh Doctor, I shall… let myself out and… wait.” The Reaper, witnessing this, felt quite awkward too. He hovered out of his seat. “I shall see you when you’re… huh?” His Death Tablet vibrated. Doctor Cobble, visibly shocked, muttered, “never mind… you’ve seen the worst of me now. I… wahh!! I AM MORTIFIED!” The Reaper unlocked his tablet. The first name the showed up was “Molly Coddle”. “No way!” he yelled. “I… I… Uggh!!” Doctor Cobble let out as her embarrassment took over her sanity, and there she fell onto the ground on her own puddle, curled up. She died. “I hate my job.”"

The shooters make the public push forward quicker on these measure to incite civil unrest within the right-wing groups. Its called ""Accelerationism"". They know that these public shootings cause public outrage despite being a fraction of a fraction of overall gun violence and cause public tp respond in an emotional and reactionary way. The media plays into it big time. The more attention we give them, the more shootings are going to happen.

Same with purple-blue, green-brown, red-brown, yellow-orange, orange-red. In this case the product came in two blue varieties and one purple variety, and I could never for the life of me remember which one was purple. To me they just looked like like, dark, and darker blue."
"""Common sense"" is a crutch term, similar to ""Instinct."" Common sense refers to all the things that we know that we don't know _how_ we know. We also use the term ""common sense"" in a general way, to refer to things that we believe _most_ people would agree on even if they don't know why. Since our common sense consists mostly of things that we know that we don't know how we know, it's very difficult to teach them to someone who doesn't already know them. But it is possible for most humans to learn ""new"" patterns of common sense through observation and experimentation. For instance, to most technologically literate people, clicking an [X] icon to close a window is common sense. It's just what that symbol means. And we recognize it even when it looks different, whether it be red or white, circular or round, in the main window or in a pop-up window. Since we realize that the important thing about this symbol is that it's always shaped like an X and is usually in the corner of something, we could teach people who don't know it yet that ""if you see an X in the very corner of a window, it's probably used to close the window."" But teaching someone every single symbol they might see on a computer screen is a bad way to go about it, because they would get overwhelmed and forget a lot of them. A better way to teach computer literacy is to slowly introduce people to the ideas we take for granted, showing them things in waves and letting them experiment before moving on. A similar approach can be applied to common sense. We call it ""preschool."""
"""Congratulations Ivan, you are the first human to witness the Barrier."" The pupils of Cataar's catlike eyes expanded. Ivan knew enough about Elonaki biology to know it meant either excitement, or fear. The Barrier undulated gracefully, a sea that shimmered with blue that transitioned to green, then red, then yellow, back to blue, and every color in between. The Elonaki fleet, Ivan as its passenger, kept its distance from the energy field. This was the thing that had prevented races from leaving the Milky Way. It surrounded the galaxy, shaped like a flattened eggshell, and nobody could cross it. Those who did had a way of not returning. ""You are also to become the first human to cross the Barrier."" Turning his head to a navigator Cataar ordered, ""Take us through."" Cataar's cruiser moved forward, the fleet of other craft behind. At the pre-determined distance, the ship launched a rapid fire volley of energy bolts at the Barrier. As though a wounded animal, the Barrier jerked and twisted where it was being shot at. Other ships poked with similar weapons at their own places, making the Barrier writhe. Minutes passed but finally the energy field snapped open around them, creating a hole that would only last long enough for them to pass through. ""Proceeding through the Barrier a top sublight speed,"" the navigator announced. The fleet weaved through the energy tendrils which spurted out from the sides of the tear in the Barrier. One shook Cataar's ship, striking its starboard side. ""F deck reporting power outages,"" Engineer Saro said. ""We're fine, keep going,"" Cataar assured the crew. The wound in the Barrier began closing. The last couple craft were close enough to it when it was close to sealed that they experienced power fluctuations. But they got through."

"""Getting drunk"" every night is different from having a drink with the same frequency. I know plenty of highly functional adults who have a drink every day and have a perfectly healthy relationship with alcohol. Studies have even shown that red wine, for example, when consumed this way can have heart benefits. How is this different from smoking a small amount every day? With the buildup of tolerance most people who smoke often aren't getting stoned out of their minds regularly. I think one also needs to consider that a large number of people may be self-medicating with pot, and the problem there usually has more to do with inadequate access to effective healthcare than addiction. Plenty of people use weed in place of or in addition to daily medications to treat mental health issues, gastric problems like IBS, and pain issues which may not be as visible as their drug use. Obviously it's not ideal that these people are using drugs to treat their problems without medical supervision, but we should work on developing our healthcare system to help these sorts of people and allow them whatever helps in the meantime, not get them thrown in jail, where they will likely have even less adequate care, just for trying (however misguidedly) to feel better."
