Hope I’m not too late but can you draw a turtle eating a pickle? I think turtles and pickles are both green

I own 2 FSL sets and have always bought green for 2k, sorry.
Thank you, finally someone who agrees. So the green stains on my bed are fine right? /s
OP is one of the new AI that can green screen without a green screen.
Yes, the vast majority of actively publishing climate scientists – 97 percent – agree that humans are causing global warming and climate change.  — [American Association for the Advancement of Science](http://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/migrate/uploads/aaas_climate_statement.pdf)  — [American Chemical Society](https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/policy/publicpolicies/sustainability/globalclimatechange.html)  — [American Geophysical Union](http://sciencepolicy.agu.org/files/2013/07/AGU-Climate-Change-Position-Statement_August-2013.pdf)  — [American Meteorological Society](https://www.ametsoc.org/ams/index.cfm/about-ams/ams-statements/statements-of-the-ams-in-force/climate-change/) "The Geological Society of America (GSA) concurs with assessments by the National Academies of Science (2005), the National Research Council (2006), and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2007) that global climate has warmed and that human activities (mainly greenhouse‐gas emissions) account for most of the warming since the middle 1900s." — [The Geological Society of America](https://www.geosociety.org/gsa/positions/position10.aspx)  — [U.S. National Academy of Sciences](http://masgc.org/assets/uploads/publications/528/tna_cc.pdf)
Safe bet that he thinks scientists back in the good ol' days were trustworthy. Good him, that's true. As for the present, Fox News is a propaganda machine unlike anything on the left. They've been convincing viewers that *"billionaire George Soros"* and the *"green energy industrial complex"* are lobbying and paying *"bags and bags of money"* to corrupt scientists in labs and universities all around the world in order to falsify data to support the *"apocalyptic global warming narrative"* so that they can make bank on their *"solar panel schemes that everyone knows are doomed to failure, because what happens when the clouds come out? Uh-oh, no electricity for you. Green energy, they call it that because the money they're using to line the pockets of those so-called scientists is green."*
Introduced positive: Free exchange of science would lead to all levels of industry having access to cutting-edge and more efficient processes. Subtracted negative: Under capitalism, the dominant oil industry derails public transportation and other green initiatives.
It's not really green at all... Wrong sub. It was interesting though!
Get a 1200 watt LED grow light and blast a seed heater, I bet you can get some good seeds popped and toughened up in time for some late fall harvest action. Remember that greenhouse is gonna allow you to keep them later!
Right ever watch the avengers ? I just saw endgame because I loosely follow them but don't give a shit. The acting was terrible, you can tell they are just fucking around in front of a green screen. Its a bummer because some of the actors in it have a lot of talent but it just doesn't come through with a movie destined to sell well in China
Post reported as spam. Buying things is not green or sustainable.
"source third food sustainably" Impossible. Simply put. Macdiesels is the exact opposite of a sustainable food model. My guess is they are gonna replace 30% of the meat in their burgers with recyled cardboard. Making the big mac cheaper and more flavorfull. This is the most BS greenwashing I have ever seen.
Oh dude I grew up in a place where I was uncut but most people were circumcised. My health teacher in highschool when circumcision was brought up said plain and flat that circumcised penises were cleaner and she had her son cut. My friends and I were pretty open with each other and a few people looked over at me. Even when I was really little I asked my mom why my penis looked different and I was horrified to hear the answer at such a young age. I was super self conscious about it and I didn't lose my virginity until I was 18, and then all the chicks I got with seemed to love it or not care. Maybe two or three girls were a little taken aback at first but grew to like it or not care. I have also had to deal with an occasional yeast infection which is gross but really isn't that bad, haven't had one in years. The worst part was probably when I was fucking this chick and my frenulum which is a little tight ripped. (You can Google it if you want details) anyway I look down and there was some blood but I was drunk and didn't really feel it, I thought she was on the rag so we sorta just gave up and called it a night. The next morning when I went to take a piss it burned like hell fire. I went to the doctors long story short what didn't kill me made me stronger, it healed on it's own. I guess what I'm trying to say is that the grass is always greener, the catch is though, I love my foreskin it's my favorite part of my whole body, even though it can stir up some drama every now and again I would not trade it for anything. BUT if I wanted to I could go get snipped and see what it feels like. I have the choice. You my friend do not have the choice, and that sucks, and I'm sorry. That's why I'm so against circumcision, that and it is unnecessary, it's ugly, it's densensitiving and you are inflicting a terrible pain on a new born child at a time where you should be nurturing, protecting, and loving this defenseless being. You my friend have to play with the hand you were dealt, or in this case, the penis you were dealt. Use it wisely, it's like your signature, be careful where you stick it because it can get you into some pretty deep shit.
I The Owl and the Pussy-cat went to sea In a beautiful pea-green boat, They took some honey, and plenty of money, Wrapped up in a five-pound note. The Owl looked up to the stars above, And sang to a small guitar, "O lovely Pussy! O Pussy, my love, What a beautiful Pussy you are, You are, You are! What a beautiful Pussy you are!" II Pussy said to the Owl, "You elegant fowl! How charmingly sweet you sing! O let us be married! too long we have tarried: But what shall we do for a ring?" They sailed away, for a year and a day, To the land where the Bong-Tree grows And there in a wood a Piggy-wig stood With a ring at the end of his nose, His nose, His nose, With a ring at the end of his nose. III "Dear Pig, are you willing to sell for one shilling Your ring?" Said the Piggy, "I will." So they took it away, and were married next day By the Turkey who lives on the hill. They dined on mince, and slices of quince, Which they ate with a runcible spoon; And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand, They danced by the light of the moon, The moon, The moon, They danced by the light of the moon.
Stony iron meteorites are awesome, even little ones are like 30 dollarS, and I am talking under a gram , and they are extremely dense, but not as dense as other types of meteorites. At this point I'm just rambling, but did you know they have not confirmed if the greenish glassier mineral on this meteorite was formed in space, or during it's collision with earth... I love meteorites, that should really be my username. Can I change my username and keep my karma??
electric cars are really greenwashed. Those batteries are highly toxic, and can not be disposed of easily. Its very optimistic and trendy to think we will create sustainable societies. In reality we will deplete the worlds resources and then try and do damage control. Food prices will continue to go up to as population increases. The wealthy will control a higher percentage of the worlds resources while population levels off, and the poor will perish.

Funny smelling cigarettes? are they green inside?
So I'm on Timeline#6 currently, havent yet got to Titan. The "population" text on Earth and Moon and some of the fortunes that have a green background are pretty hard to see. The settings could use a darker outline also, they aren't as hard to read as the others though. Will update once I'm back to Mars/Jupiter and Titan.
Pineapple, pepperoni and green olives on pizza. The sweet and salty is just so damn good!
Building a greenhouse is much cheaper, and easier than you'd imagine. Keeps in the smell, is good for colder climates, and can be built with tinted film and then no one can see in. It just needs a little watering, though. I have one for legal plants, but I'm sure I could grow a plant or two and no one would notice. My old place was deep in the mountains, so I had no issue back then. Little more urban now.
That's true. You can only cross the green line if the space is vacant, that meaning, you can't capture over a green line.
Oh great, now it's even harder to filter out the green apple ones.
No. Obama's order stopped the processing of refugee applications only. It didn't stop folks from visiting on visas or green cards. And only from Iraq, which is where the two Al-Qaeda refugees originated. Trump's order was for more countries, included folks who would otherwise be able to travel legitimately (I think he's backed that off now though), and was not in response to any specific event. "Trump came up with his Muslim ban following the Orlando nightclub shooting, an attack committed not by refugees or migrants, but by a US citizen who was born in New York." ([source](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/no-barack-obama-jimmy-carter-9717520))  Except none of the countries have had a terrorist originate from them. If you're going to argue that, you need to include Saudi Arabia and others on the ban list as well.  These are mostly countries that consider themselves actively at war with the Israeli state over Gaza. And the Israel-Palestine conflict has been a hot issue for decades, so you can't say there's no outrage about it.  Possibly, but it also gains a fair bit of outrage just on the stuff contained therein. An "unfair amount"? No. The administration has not been the slightest bit empathetic, even going out of its way to childishly insult anyone who disagrees with it.
He's not going to be Maryland's governor forever, and assuming he remains cancer free he's probably going to want to move on to something bigger afterwards. I would find him an acceptable presidential candidate myself, and I'm definitely not a Republican. However, by not backing the party's nominee, he may have limited his options down the road. He may not want to disassociate himself from his party, but there's a chance that they disassociate themselves from him. If I were left high and dry like that, I would definitely move on for greener pastures.
Hershel's leg is not a good example to show that they could easily throw in the amputation of Rick's hand. They found creative ways to get avoid the use of green screen, such as draping pants beyond the stump, giving him a prosthesis, etc. A hand will be exponentially more difficult and expensive. I wonder if the same thing happening to a character in another major TV show that comes on right after TWD's season ends held any sway over their decision.
In most areas (EDIT: in the US), diesel uses green nozzles.
It looked to me like the camera realized what happened, then looked at the light in the intersection to check if it was green or not, almost as if that was relevant to what it just saw. Kinda creepy.
Zoom zoom green
This is why as a Canadian citizen that has a green card and lives in Chicago, I stay out of the Bible thumper states as much as I can.

I got banned from r/racism just for commenting on a r/greentext post
I always come to the conclusion that green screens are used in this situations, but I'm never fully satisfied. There's something we don't know!!!!
Not just the green ones, but the little ones too
Ooh, I have an idea. In the latest green screen one, there's a part where Ian opens the window and acts like he is seeing a tragedy: Can you put the clip where Jack points out that his channel name has "TV" in it.?
Fuck off vogel for keeping green
Lmao this guy tried his best to make the AD trade look lopsided in favor of the Pelicans. I bet he wishes it was the green team that traded for him.
You mean like it has a green check mark and says it's been imported, right? It's the only world state I imported. I did all that, it's just it didn't say what I had called it when I started up the game. Like, so far Varric hasn't really spoken of Hawke or Anders so I can't do the easy check of "Okay, is my Hawke still a female and is Anders dead?" The one thing that supported my world state was the Requisition Officer mentioning that Anora was queen when talking about Loghain. Not sure if that means Alistair isn't around (he's dead in my world state).
I was making a joke about your typo. But while we're on the topic, once you're out of the relationship, you're going to miss it. Grass is always greener blah blah.
I was playing I Spy with my sister and my mom, when I was 7. I swear that garbage bin looked green.
Legendary and Common / Epic and Rare look identical without close inspection of the details. I've looted many common (green) items thinking they were legendary when there is a legendary on the ground near by.

Chicken and green beans, chicken and green beans, chicken and green beans. We'd buy a bunch, cook them, freeze them, and I take them to work. Dinners are similar but with a wider variety of meats and vegetables plus cheese. We don't really do anything fancy and we never try to make mock foods. I stopped tracking my food pretty early on and just kept a mental log of carbs so I can't really comment on calories, but I do imagine half of the diet's effect comes from lack of food availability leading to general lack of calories
I definitely look both ways before going at a green light after browsing that sub frequently.
Buy a private jet and take her to northern greenland.
Sorry about the artifacts I just now noticed, I don't know what went wrong. I tried to make this again without re sizing it but that green line is still there. I hope it doesn't happen again if I make more gifs from this file.
I realize that but when it gets to the higher tier ships you'd think they'd be rolling in enough cash money green to have their own ship.
The green card was fuzzy, so I put down fuzz.
You mean something like lipton green tea? I could drink a ton of those, you think that'd be bad for me?
Cash, money, green.
I definitely have that, but sometimes things get crazy. One time I got home from Iron man 3 and it was kind of dark inside. As I was taking my shoes off, an outer corner of the walls began to send out green pulses. I looked at it from different angles for about half a minute until I didn't notice it before. Closed eye visuels are crazy too. They're very dim, and very fuzzy, but there's not a doubt in my mind these aren't just thought images or anything. I'll lay down at night watching random geometric shapes and images fade into eachother. The most animated and visual one looked something like these http://assets.windows8wallpaper.us/2011/09/22/2115/65656/960x600/psychedelic-960x600.jpg http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQRrNWxZQeEVwufjOONipHa4aDWK_hcJy59mxxej3hkKSCzEwEf http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQaasihYP3glDrde60FTpDQPn9yk42B4DCVQ-e9kgdaXmmRT1Ceag only it was a lot more... inconsistent.

I was having my pignigga farming trees when one of the trees killed him. After trying to avoid the tree dude for a couple days I found out he's not agro. Worried that he might kill the pignigga when he respawns I decided to lead him into bait him into the swamp so he would farm tentacle spikes and hopefully die. And then, well, yeah. EDIT: WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT THING IN THE PANIC PICTURE
Fuck you it's green. upbaots
I thought it was green. I'm colorblind, I demand to know the truth.
If you're saying voting in general is not enough, yes that is correct. Everyone really should do it though because it adds some legitimacy to the "other" actions that need to happen. If you're saying the Green party is part of the "masters" then I'm sorry to inform you that's not the case. It's hard enough to get a minority voice heard without splitting between the green and the populists.
It's not uncommon for Sriracha mayo to include some lime juice to thin it out. And I'm not saying Greek yogurt dressings aren't uncommon, it's literally the same concept as mayo-based dressings, like ranch. I'm just saying I would never toss greens in Sriracha mayo, or yogurt. Ranch is pretty gross when you think about it, but it has seasonings to make up for it. This dressing's only seasoning is Sriracha.
I'm a big fan of the "green eggs and ham" special from a while back.
You mean green onions right? Cause cooking with chives as part of the base would get expensive real quick.
Similarly, Hillary lost Ohio and Florida by less votes than Republicans got in those states. If the people who voted Donald Trump had switched to Hillary, WE WOULD NOT HAVE Trump. We also would have one less rapist on the Supreme Court. Worth it tho right??? tboy those guys prove their point, really showed everybody. Trump or die, literally.  I'm saying this all because you can't expect people to sacrifice their voting principles for the sake of unity behind a candidate who people have legitimate reasons not to be elected. I don't know why liberals expect unity but only with their candidates. It is the job of the candidate to earn the votes, ideally through policy proposals. Hillary didn't earn those votes, presumably because those who voted green care about fighting climate change which Hillary had no good plan for. If Biden wants to earn any of those votes, he needs to come up with a better proposal than "not Trump."
Non shitty answer real quick: Head on down to /r/colorblind for a fun time with this picture. I'm still pretty convinced that the bag is green and anyone who says otherwise is just trying to fuck with me.
Yes but the fact that there was a ban on legal immigration for no real reason other than politics is important. If you had a green card, but were from one of those countries, you better not leave because you're not coming back. The fact that a ban was drawn up at all provides uncertainty with immigration. Politics aside, because of the ban, immigration services have been severely bogged down with cases they have to sort out, meaning if there is any problem at all with visas, it'll be even harder to sort out.
On the other end of the spectrum, if you're behind me honking the moment the light turns green, or sometimes before it even turns green, you can bet your ass I'll take my time turning.
Strange, I normally use ults more offensively, catching people out or splitting the enemy, is that still good? Also what do you think of the idea of running first blood mastery + green father's gift and doing a level 1 cheese? I've found I can get a solo first blood on enemy adc early or force summs, but that's just my experience.
It's probably a lot of "the grass is always greener". We're not getting either of those. It's a huge confidence boost whenever I get hit on, and I definitely see it as a real compliment since it happens so rarely. I've also noticed a lot of compliments from other females, which I also think counts. Like, I don't really care if it's a guy or girl that compliments me, it's a compliment nonetheless!
It changed? There are no Greenlandic flag in /r/europe and I use the Danish one here. I use the Greenlandic flag in /r/Denmark and I am a CSS mod in /r/greenland. If you doubting me, go through my profile, and you will find tons of times were I said I am Greenlandic. If you mean the comment on my flag flair, I had to explain so many times I am Greenlandic living in Denmark, I simply just changed it so I can use less time to explain. ^^^But ^^^ignore ^^^all ^^^the ^^^comments ^^^I ^^^made ^^^on ^^^NSFW ^^^subs, ^^^please.
Again, have people not heard of "the devil's advocate?" He didn't "BTFO" Dansken, Dansken said arguments that a person from the opposite political spectrum would make to bring out Rosling's arguments more. I'm not a dane who is butthurt, I'm a greenlander who views it from an objective perspective.
Many greenlanders are feeling guilt, sorrow, and solidarity with Iceland. With news of both Birna and the murder of the 20 year old in Skagen, it is indeed a difficult time in greenland emotinally. But we will both get through it.
Using this theme in /r/greenland. Thanks.
Only few danes learn greenlandic since danish is the lingua franca in greenland. I know one ethnically dane who knows Greenlandic, but only because her family studies inuit culture, and runs an inuit museum. She grew up in Greenland, but other danes, even though they also grew up in Greenland, don't bother to learn it.
I recently moved to Denmark for education, anyone who wants a higher education than highschool has to go to denmark to study. But I think I'll return once the education is over(3-5 years?). Denmark is flat as fuck. The internet service in greenland is shit. Too slow and too expensive. That because Tele Greenland has monopoly on Internet in Greenland, as no other company wants to invest in a remote place with few people.
Not a grassroot, but political parties, Demokraatit(The democrats), and Inuit Ataqatsigiit(United Inuit). Denmark handles all foreign affairs, so greenland has to go through Denmark for everything, that includes contact with other inuit in Canada or Alaska, which is a bummer, and those parties has been strong advocates for closer relation with Iqaluit, the canadian inuit capital town.
There's no series of any kind, but there have been a handful of movies, but I don't think you can stream them. They are sold in DVDs, or are circulating around Greenland as ripped videos from said DVDs. If you find a way, then I'd recommend Qaqqat Alanngui, and Qaamarngup uummataa. Other than that, there are few youtube videos, and KNR puts up news from greenland on youtube.
There's plenty enough speakers to survive, but the question is how much of it will be loanwords as oppose to greenlandic words. Will it be like English, where it is a Germanic language, but most words have latin origin, or will it retain much of it's own words? Currently, I'd say there are more greenlandic words than loanwords, but I don't know if it could change. We also have plenty of books, but they are mostly in book-book form, rather than digital.
Kinda hard to explain what "kutattoq" is to an non-greenlander, but imagine a baby who struggles say the letter "V", but instead says the letter "B". That's common in babies, and in few months or years, they learn to pronounce the letter "V". Tunumiusut, to an west-greenlander, sounds like someone who hasn't learned to do that, but instead of V and B, it is with whole words and phrases. They say Ittoqqotoormiit instead of illoqqotoormiut. It sounds like they can't pronounce L, and U. It's a different language, they speak different, but to the ears of an kalaaleq(west-greenlander), it's sounds like a baby.
Basically names for technology are loanwords, cellphones/smartphones are called "mobiili"(from danish "mobil"), Ipad-ti, tableti. But a PC is called either Kompiuuteri, or Qarasaasiaq(lit.: "Brain-storage"). Then there's business/workplace names, Banki is bank, fabrikki(from danish fabrik) is factory, but office is allaffik(lit.: place to write). It's kinda 50/50 whether or not there is a greenlandic name for workplaces. The question about scandinavian languages, many greenlanders have danish as second language, and some of them as mother-language, so we're able to know if the scandinavian being spoken is danish or not, but we still can't differentiate between Norwegian and Swedish, since both are more high-pitched, and sounds like they are singing instead of speaking.
Kujataani Ilinniarnertuungorniarfik(the south highschool) is the word I like the best, since it is a long-ass word and because of that, danes don't usually believe it is a word when I tell them I studied there. Also, it literally means "place to become highly educated in the south". the south being south-greenland.
There's was a dane, who unfortunately recently passed, that lived many years in Narsaq with his family, and had learned Greenlandic quite a lot. His wife runs the inuit museum in Narsaq. Their child, even though she is 100% dane, can speak Greenlandic, because she grew up in Narsaq. ~~The tumblr user is greenlandic, it seems, so the resource is pretty reliable.~~ Huh, seems like the person is just really well informed on Greenlandic language.
Hey, I found https://oqaasileriffik.gl/en/ while I was browsing greenlandic education sites.
Qallunaat - Danes, originally meant foreigner, but danes were the dominant foreigners, they just took over the meaning. Now foreigners translates to "Nuna allamioq"(lit. from other land). I think I'll add other words that might come into mind later, but this seems like a word that doesn't get mentioned when greenlandic is discussed. singular: Kutattoq, plural: Kutattut. It's a word for describing childish speak. Restroom is Anartarfik(lit.: place to excremate) Bathroom is Uffarfik(lit.: place to take a bath) Bedroom is Sinittarfik(lit.: place to sleep) -fik is used to indicate place to do something. another example a store is Pisiffik(lit.: place to buy) Room is Ini. also, livingroom is Ineeraq(lit.:small room) Computer translates to Qarasaasiaq, but everyone has started to just call it kompiuuteri, loanword from danish komputer.
East-greenlandic speakers gets bullied in school on how they sound "childish"(Kutattut), so that's a problem I would like to see solved. They get bullied because the way they speak resembles baby-greenlandic. They are also more uncontaminated greenlandic, where they use fewer loanwords from danish or english. I can understand about 70% of what they're saying. North-Greenlandic is difficult, since it is closer to Inuktitut, than Greenlandic, and I can't for the life of me, understand Inuktun and inuktitut, I can probably understand 40% of what they say. But if they say the words slowly, one by one, I can understand them.
Around 85% of the population of Greenland is Greenlandic, and most of them speak Greenlandic, but split up in West-Greenlandic(Kalaallisut), East-Greenlandic, which is it's own language(Tunumiusut), North-Greenlandic(Avannarmiusut, but they prefer to call it Inuktun). Kalaallisut has two dialects, U-dialect, and I-dialect. I speak the U-dialect. Then there are also 15000 greenlanders living in Denmark, but many children grew up in danish speaking environment, so younger generation are danish speaker, while older generations are native greenlandic speakers.
That's what I mean, he says it is inuktitut, but it is greenlandic. In inuktitut, Ainnga is used as a greeting, but in greenlandic, it is used to indicate something is there, not as a greeting.
Funny thing is, more danes are on average, likely to be alcoholics than Greenlandic. This happens because danes are more likely to recognize greenlanders as greenlandic when they are holding a beverage, but more likely to think they are asian if they are not. ~~That's racist.~~
Also explains Niels Bohr. You'd have to be a genius to know the danish counting system. And before you assume me being dane, I'm greenlandic living in denmark, and I am as confused as all other nordics.
Running on 100% green energy.
I personally feel like Iceland, Faroe Islands and Greenland has a different bond, different from what I see between Nordic countries. We have many so families that have married into each countries that we have basically made 'new minorities', so Half-greenlandic-Half-Icelandic and Half-Greenlandic-Half-Faroes populations are quite large in South-Greenland, and I am fortunate enough to know many of them. Most of Half-Icelanders are in Farming business, while most Half-Faroes are Fisher-men. Am I not right in thinking that it is the same with Iceland?
Interesting. But would it not make more sense to build a westgreenlandic-style qajaq to match the paddle?

It has been done before. There was a Japanese woman that dogsled from north-greenland to south-greenland, but that was many years ago. Then there is also the Sirius Patrol, where danish soldiers dogsleds around the national park.
what? are you trying to write greenlandic, or are you mocking us?
Claim to be a scientist that have found an alternative energysource, easily produceable, cheap, and very green, when in fact it is poisonous gas that will consume the whole world. And they live happily ever after. THE END
~~God's~~ your boss farts *ARE* the cause of Climate Change. lol but seriously, In greenland's icecap, the newest layer of ice contains more pollution than all the ice layers created more than 150 years ago *COMBINED*. So it proves that since humans started running on fossil fuel, that the the climate have drastically have been changing. Ice is the "almost" perfect diary of the worlds climate. "almost" because it can melt and the data it holds will be gone forever.
Are u assuming that I’m not green?
I never thought about it but that looks a lot like the Spotify logo 😱. You should’ve made it green.
I replied to a guy lower down who needed some education on how colorblindness worked and I noted that the green crosses practically blend in the the background making them easy to ignore. Maybe the creator of this infographic is a protan and they liked that it blended in. Who knows, works for us.
Fuck...I'm colorblind and I thought there was only one green.

I don't know who those are but the green one looks like a love machine
I have a question for the Japanophiles of this thread, are aliens traditionally treated differently in Japan than America? We have a whole culture around little green men, flying saucers, and Area 51, but are there any established tropes like this in Japan? When I think about how an American writer would write a scenario of being broken by aliens, I imagine one of those crazy guys ([(spoilers?)like Russel from independence day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyOTaHRBTXc)) talking about being abducted and experimented on, but of course the idea never goes as far as Muv Luv. I'm not assuming Alternative is the norm, but are there any tropes that they would've used instead?
The game is cheaper right now on green man gaming
Well a "green house" doesn't really describe anything more specific than a physical house that's painted green. And I think given context, you would easily be able to distinguish both.
I believe a green house is called that because it more succinctly describes "a room designed to prolifically grow plants". Unlike how "sauteed cheese" would adequately describe what most people call a "grilled cheese".
Chipotle is green. This one is going to the moon. Maybe not as fast as a biotech but still.
Why on gods green earth does anyone need a Lamborghini? I've owned assault rifles for 30 years. I use them to shoot paper targets and the occasional old water heater. The issue runs deeper than guns. Where there is a will there's a way. If you can't buy a $2000 rifle you can still drive a $600 car into a crowd of people or make a pipe bomb for $20 or pick up a machete from Walmart for $7.
It's San Francisco California. They have 2 more walgreens locations and 3 other dedicated pharmacies in city limits. They have some of the best public transportation in the nation. Walgreens opened that store to make money, not to do anyone a favor. You know that because they closed it when it wasn't making money and not when people stopped needing it. Stop drinking the corporate kool-aid.
Alas! What grim news! Whatever shall the residents of the poor village of the San Francisco metropolitan area do without the local apothecary? However will a meager population of over 883,000 survive with only 5 other pharmacies of which two are also Walgreens?
Still can’t catch it in leaf green. It may have been diamond since iirc that’s the first time they were wild
Sylvain always says it would’ve been better if he never had a crest, but I suppose the grass is greener on the other side.
Tbh if she joins after the valley of torment with her bases from the Azure Moon chapter with her as a green unit, she’ll he oretty good
Jokes on you, I can’t see green!
You’re right. Holy shit all potential halberdiers have green hair
Awakening still has green units you must keep alive. Like in the paralogue with the NPC Anna where you have suicidal greenies who wan to be killed by risen
Good thing almost every green putt breaker is good
If you're gonna pull on this banner, may as well pull for him. Hard to say you're pity broken on green now considering most of it is amazing units
I still doubt it. He's green after all
Need her as a green mage with a broken new inheritable tone just so we can fodder her off to Nino
But it wasn't called ally until fe6. Also Travant and his wyverns in fe4 chapter 5 were also green
*kill 20 level 35+ green mages with Reinhardt*
That’s weird since she didn’t have an apple is. She had an Android. A few texts back [you can see it’s green](https://i.imgur.com/sGFaYXd.png)
"I swear I just summoned on green as a joke thinking if get Bartre"
Bloribal Bloribur, Your green orbs are now Arthur
Well, being a green mage is usually enough to be a hard counter to Rein
In FE3 book 2 and FE12, you can use the Aum staff to bring back Lorenz. Zephiel is recruitable on a second playthrough of FE6 if you talk to him with Guinavere, who you get in the third chapter now as a mage. Murdock can life if you have Guinavere talk to him too Talking to Reinhardt with Olwen turns his army green and he helps out. Shigen betrays you in Tearring Saga and you have to kill him until his personal weapon, the Dullahan, which brings him back to life, breaks. It has 40 uses
[Like this?](http://gentlepony.com/pics/nuclear-arms3_green.gif)
They are the characters you get through prologue-chapter 2 without being green units. Maybe it wasn't a defend map, but I think they were originally supposed to be playable from the start of the game. That'd only be 6 characters from the start, the same as FE6
Inb4 she's a green tome user with insane res and attack. Since Thani is effective against Cavalry and Armors, she'd be THE REINHARDT slayer
I want them to make Micaiah a colorless mage, but considering they made Julia, another light magic user (and her mother is her aunt and dad is her uncle. A wizard trying to resurrect a dark god made them bang. Also if you abuse the jealousy system, you can make her and Seliph, her half brother, bang) a green tome user, I won't hold my breath.
I was thinking both the player AND THE ENEMY would kill green units!
Now green units will die TWICE as fast!
We are ALL green units on this blessed day
You know what I'm surprised FE5 never did? Make a map with a lot of weak ass green units and enemies that level up when they kill them
Hi Donna. Alex and I went there last night. Alex really liked their fried greens, but I personally couldn't taste anything since I burned my tastebuds on their fried greens. They also looked at me weird since I asked for some iced tea with no ice but still has ice in it.
The greenies in Dwyer's join chapter are pretty cool I guess
TIL Rebecca's hair is green
And then he fucks her green hair clone in Valentia
She's pretty good. Basically green Lilina that destroys Manaketes
Blame Hannibal. He easily could've just turned green instead
Fine, you'd be a level 1 green unit from the prologue of Requiem, meaning everyone hates you since you're useless and steal kills
Yeah, but you'd just be a level 1 green unit
$50 dollars to recount, the rest to the green party
Great job, but remember to not overeat at all after the surgery, since it would just make it irrelevant. Also if you want to try to switch it up, try a NO carb diet. While yes, it's impossible to go completely no carb, you can go a step beyond low carb! Basically meat and green veggies, no fruits bread or anything like that, kay? EDIT: I mean after your surgery, but you still should be low carb on your liquid diet
Kaze looks So much younger than he is. Such is the life of a green cav besides Kyle and Alec
You can buy a lot of Walgreens champagne for that
Almost a third of Preludes have building tags - if you play two of those, that's a free plant production right out of the gate. Even if the power only gets you one greenery that's still pretty good as far as corp bonuses go.
I mrsn, it *can* deny a greenery, but getting that perfect AR where it gets 2 heat bonuses AND one of your opponents has 8+ plants is quite rare - usually you have to choose and end up sacrificing one for the other.
People are severely underestimating this card. It's the best of the microbe-action cards and only takes one conversion (3 generations) to pay for itself, and that's not counting the science tag. Beyond that, there are so many ways to add microbes to other cards (besides what's been mentioned, there's Viral Enhances, various space events, etc). Perhaps more importantly, the temperature raise and the requirement are orthogonal - meaning that if you have the plant production to hit the O2 requirement, this card won't cannibalize the TR you would have gotten from greeneries (like Regolith Eaters would). Instead it cannibalizes the TR from people who went heat-heavy or stocked up on space events.
I guess it comes down do your groups play style. If you're slapping down a lot of early cities then yeah the game's going to last longer and fill more of the board. Personally don't think it's an efficient use of MC before the mid-to-late game. It's unlikely anyone else what place next to your city so you'll need to build at least two more greeneries before your city is VP efficient. Assuming a standard project.
It's 26 MC, for that you can pretty much always get a city next to two greeneries, and often three
Well yeah, over 14 generations, that's an extra ~80 MC w/ steel and titanium, nearly two free greeneries, and three temp steps. Not a small advantage.
Does this weird green text thing work for you on 4chan? It's not making you look as clever as you think it is
They do. You just cut out the starchy veggies that are generally nutrient-poor anyway (potatoes, corn). Broccoli, cauliflower, spinach, brussels sprouts, green beans, asparagus, spinach, carrots - all great. At least for me, it's pretty easy to eat primarily poultry, veggies, and dairy (cheese, full fat yogurt, etc) and still stay around 30-40g of carbs.
How do you remember which are the neutral cities/greeneries if you don't mark them?
Fannie MoButts would want you to honor her sacrifice by fighting on. She's and her neon green hot pants are looking down on you from Ayy Heaven.
Yeah I don't think OP read that rule correctly. You can always place a greenery. The restriction is that if you CAN place it next to other tiles you own, you MUST do so.
And people on meth have tons of energy, so they walk everywhere, which is suuuuper green
I'd love to know where in the North end they think they're putting a green line stop
Haha. Also making sure the game doesn't screw you over. I just had an Advent Rocketeer on green patrol on the other side of the map (concealed shinobi could see him) and he somehow teleported by himself to directly behind by squad, activating his whole pod still on the other side of the map.
I'm not trying to offend, but your reply clearly shows you really don't understand the scope of a Mars mission. Getting from where Germany was circa 1940 to Mars in thirty years is just not happening short of little green men showing up. I don't care if the society is devoting itself 100% to the endeavor (and looking at all the effort they're putting into consolidating their new colonies, they're not). Having rocket planes and monorails isn't even scratching the surface of what you'd need. There are so many technological jumps in different areas needed. And most of the best German rocket scientists ended up working for the Americans or the Russians so it's not like there's some huge untapped potential there that would accelerate a German program. I 100% agree with /u/Charlemagne_III. It's interesting from a show perspective, but in 100% impossible in practicality. EDIT: I peeked at your comment history - it just makes the pro-Nazi undertones in your comments all the more disturbing. I think we're done here.
I intuitively thought this too but it turns out it's wrong: http://www.greenbuildingadvisor.com/community/forum/energy-efficiency-and-durability/25818/ice-water-under-or-over-drip-edge
Lacy owner. Marshawn in a second. Maybe grass is greener, but it's skinnier too.
Of course it's nonsensical. Meera's conversation with Bran takes place when they're already with the CotF. If your argument was true, then Meera already helped get them there, there's no reason for Jojen to keep lying. But he keeps saying he's seen his fate and needs to get home. The fact remains: * Jojen's greendreams haven't been wrong before * They're already with the CotF, there's zero reason for him to lie to Meera spergery's explanation makes no sense.
In other news, the green line is getting automatic doors and electricity!
Clearly not a green line rider
Haha, maybe this will finally be the impetus they need to get GPS on the green line.
Agreed 100%. Kinda thought it was always grass-is-greener shit on my part. It's not. MW2 still plays silky smooth.
This is a misconception propagated by people who didn't pay attention in physics. In fact, the third rail is your best bet, as it's raised off the ground and thus has its vibrations attenuated the least. Make sure to take your sock off too. If you can, wet your foot as well for maximum transmission of......vibrations. Also, for the green line, it helps to close your eyes and cover your ears when doing this. It eliminates sensory distractions and lets you pick up much more faint vibrations.
I thought so for a split second too, but way too much non-flat green space
The heat bubble can be addressed by having more green space and less exposed asphalt/concrete in cities, and a central AC system that pumps heat away more efficiently, like district heating in reverse.
As far as I'm aware the federal government has always called it carbon pricing or greenhouse gas pricing.
Which is why she wants to fund early pensions for older oil and gas workers and guarantee jobs in oil sands cleanup or green energy for all other oil and gas workers, I guess.
I want to see Nova Scotia adopt 100% green electricity, an expansion of intercity and intracity public transport, and an end to fossil fuel subsidies. What sort of change should I be in order to achieve that?
...and those fossil fuels are turned into plastic instead of being emitted into the atmosphere, so it’s not a greenhouse gas problem. Energy intensive doesn’t matter if the energy is renewable.
We could build an identical copy of Point Lepreau NPP on our side of the Bay of Fundy and replace all of our coal emissions. A second copy and we're producing 100% green electricity.
The goal is net zero. Wealthy countries should be the first to hit net zero and should then subsidize green technology for developing countries.
90% of the revenue is returned to people in their tax returns, 10% is used for green initiatives.
They're running a candidate in every constituency: https://www.greenparty.ca/en/ridings/ab
China and India both use Canadian CANDU nuclear powerplant designs. We can become an exporter of green tech.
Canada emits 15 tons of CO2 per capita per year. The UK emits 6 tons. France emits 5 tons. Switzerland emits 4 tons. Even among developed countries our per capita emissions are disproportionately high. In terms of total emissions, cutting our emissions would show other countries that it is possible, and with a head start on green energy we can becoming a global power in providing (selling) green tech and expertise.
[Canada emits 15 tons of greenhouse gas per capita per year.](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC?end=2014&amp;start=2014&amp;view=bar&amp;year_high_desc=true) The UK emits 6 tons. Do the British live in huts? France emits 5 tons. Do the French live in huts? Switzerland emits 4 tons. Do the Swiss live in huts?
We have [1.6% of global greenhouse gas emissions](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/environmental-indicators/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions.html), but 0.5% of the global population.
When I was turning left from Oxford northbound onto Quinpool westbound, the advance green arrow wasn't blinking, there was only a segment of time when I had a green and the opposing traffic didn't. Has that been fixed?
It's actually a good question. Most green parties I know are also socially and economically left-leaning. Are there any parties in the world that have the environment as their main issue and that are either economically or socially right-leaning?
We're one of the [smaller countries](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population) in the world. And if a small, very wealthy country like Canada can't do it, it's not much of an encouragement for others. EDIT: Doing the math, we have 0.5% of the world population. So if our greenhouse gas contribution is 1.5%, we're emitting three times as much as the average country per capita.
* As a pedestrian, you'll have to press a button to get a green light, I don't think I saw that in USA Both of these are the case in Canada.
Isn't there a greentext similar to this?
:edited because I missed a joke:  In all seriousness though, I've have seen similar posts by countless women deriding men for opting for games and whatnot, and it's usually by butthurt woman who priced themselves out of the market. When the cost of pussy is too high men are going to find other endeavors and move on to greener pastures.
While admirable, That's not the point. Her looks improving means she'll have more guys hitting on her and the grass will start looking greener unless you improved as well.
Oh no, the institution of marriage is irrevocably broken as far as I'm concerned due to the laws on teh books, family court biases, and all the incentives for women to divorce for cash &amp; prices. Tons of women who would have stuck it out are calling it quits because the grass looks greener thanks to all this.
As someone who is colorblind it just looks like she just has a good tan. The scene in the latest trek film was confusing until my friend pointed it out to me that she was green. Then I got it, Kirk hitting alien ass per usual.
While I agree, they also had an entire support system and society grooming them. Mothers, grandmothers, fathers, grandfathers, they were all setting women up to be courted and would screen suitors to a large extent. Women didn't go out and date around and pick the best of the bunch while riding the carousel the way they do today. A lot of the choices women did make were already vetted by parents well in advance. And social pressures were a lot different, not to mention the lack of birth control. All in all, women and their families had selected the man she'd marry by the time she was 19, and would have a kid or two in their early 20s. Also, there wasn't the creature comforts we have today so there wasn't really a lot of time for idle hands. Plus there weren't as many instigators to feel the grass is greener since all her peers were doing the same thing as she was. This is all what my 94 year old grandmother told me years ago, backed up by my mom and aunts over the years. Bottom line is that our culture changed, society changed, and the entire paradigm of how relationships formed and were formalized has changed. Considering what I've been told, I think the #1 factor in all this is that women aren't restrained the way they used to be, and worse, mothers are living vicariously through their young daughters so they don't advise them properly to use their prime years to settle down while they can. Instead, thanks to modern birth control, they let them run around unchecked fucking and sucking to their heart's contentment, getting their fill until their options begin to wane when their fertilitly starts to go and they race to find a "good man" to settle down and have kids with.
You don't. Breaks are just code for breaking up with the hopes of getting back together if the initiator of the break doesn't find someone else. Usually breaks are precipitated by the initiator wanting to test the waters with someone else because the grass is looking greener. My advice for anyone on the receiving end of a "break" is to make it clear you won't be waiting around and to cut off all contact with the other person.
No. There, I made the decision for you. It's that simple. She made her choice to see if the grass is greener and to fuck other guys, now you're free to put her behind you, cut off all contact, and find someone that appreciates you for who you are without wondering if they can do better.
Be careful what you wish for in the sense the grass isn't always greener on the other side of the fence. A lot of women hate male attention. Okay. But like the writer of that article mentioned, once it stopped she missed it dearly.
1. Breaks are just code for breaking up with the caveat of leaving the door open in case the grass isn't greener after all. 2. If she's out clubbing and drinking, assume she's going home with random guys every weekend "sowing her wild oats". Now ask yourself how that makes you feel. Is this a woman you want to get back together with her after this hiatus? 3. You should be out there doing the same. If she wants to go live it up, then why shouldn't you? Here's my recommendation: be clear about what you want from her and the relationship and where you see things going, and find out how she feels about the same. If you're not looking for the same things, then you're simply not a good match. It that simple.
A break is just a green-light to hook up with other people. 9 times out of 10 the person who initiates a break already has someone in mind and wants to go for it, but doesn't want to feel guilty. Furthermore, it's really passive aggressive because they're stringing the other person along as a "just in case this new person doesn't work out I'll go back".
LOL, you don't need nearly as many carbs as you thinj. 100-150g a day is more than enough for most people (good carbs from green leafy veggies, not empty carbs from chips &amp; pop). And paleo isn't a low-carb diet. Not really. It's more or less just about eating foods that aren't shitty and processed.
That happened to me the other day, not drunk, not stoned or anything. It used to be a light and it was out of service, so they put up temporary stop signs and I was on that kind of autopilot people get when they drive a routine route. I don't know how long I was stopped waiting for it to turn green, but it was long enough to wonder "WTF, this light is taking fore...OMG I'm an idiot."
Just so you know, a break means you broke up. She's now free to sleep with any guy she pleases, and reserves the right to keep you in her back pocket to go back to if things don't work out as planned. Her saying she doesn't have any experience outside your relationship tells me she's got "grass is greener syndrome" and is looking for a little *strange* to see what she's missing out on.  I'm raising the bullshit flag right now as this is grade A classic posturing. My advice, **judge her by her actions, not her words.** The odds of her messing around with other guys is almost certain.  You should NOT trust her entirely. She's on a break and free to do whoever the hell she pleases, and since you two are on a break it doesn't count as cheating so there won't be any guilt on her part (if she's hot for another guy anyway, which may have been what promoted this situation). That's the reality of the situation you need to face. Mark my words, she wants you to not move on in case her little plans don't pan out. This is why you should N E V E R agree to a "break". It's breaking up on her terms, pure and simple. There are times that all this isn't so, but those instances are so rare it's just not worth betting your emotional well-being on IMO. ---- Now for the good news: there's lots other women out there and you're bound to find someone that's a good match for you. Plus you really shouldn't waste your youth with one relationship. Get out there and experience the world, find out what you want (and don't want) in a relationship, and sample the cuisine, so to speak.
Upvote for this statement alone. And I don't know if I entirely agree with drunkeness brining out the truth. People tend to lose inhibitions and do things they want, but wouldn't normally do if they were sober. Just because she wanted to bang H doesn't mean she would have acted on it otherwise, and having G there to assuage her fears about cheating or whatever was like an extra green-light to go for it. Overall IMO 3somes with another guy is just a bad idea if you're emotionally attached to the woman involved.
This is great! Note: I can't watch the vid at work so I had to google who he was:  Read more: http://www.dnainfo.com/20111202/greenwich-village-soho/rayon-mcintosh-be-freed-mcdonalds-beating-case#ixzz1fTJofQnE
Don't delude yourself, she won't be around once she has that green card. And there's no guarantee she'll work once you're married. She could very well do the bare minimum to stay married, leach off you, and then take you for a ride afterwards. And god help you if she comes on to you and gets knocked up. Then it's citizenship AND a free ride for 18 years.
She's doing this for the green card/visa/citizenship, nothing more. Her eye is on the prize. If you got married she'll divorce your ass so fast your head would spin, likely taking half your shit in the process. You already know all of this. So why do it? For a favor to some woman you barely know? Why take that kind of risk? Also, this could very well be illegal marrying for the green card and could land your ass in jail.
A break is code for you breaking up, but with the caveat one of you wants the security blanket of getting back together in case the grass isn't greener like they thought.
Sounds like she's setting up excuses for gaining the weight back. Remember, marriages where the wife is thinner than the husband are happier more successful marriages. Furthermore, I'd flat out say it that if she can lose weight for the wedding to impress her friends or whatnot, that she can keep it off for me since I'm more important then they are. If she doesn't get it then she's probably not marriage material. As for "What can I say to her? How can I motivate her without putting her down?", you don't say anything. Let her see other women checking you out, have fun, and don't be afraid to flaunt your new desirability. That should send the message for you, doing the job of tripping the fear effect, the notion that she's lucky to have you and if she doesn't WORK to keep you then you'll move on to greener pastures. It doesn't have to be a rational fear, but that fear of loss, mixed with competition from other women, is a HUGE motivator. Works the same for men as well.
If the ratings don't drop off a bunch for the next episode they're expected to green light the next "season" which should be a full run of episodes.
This. She looks like she's pushing 30. If she really is 16 then I feel bad for the guy--just imagine what she'll look like when she really does get older :barf!: http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2011/06/21/2011-06-21_green_mile_actor_doug_hutchison_51_marries_aspiring_country_singer_courtney_alex.html On a related note, I had no idea he was that old.  From the article:  I don't know if the author is trying to be sarcastic or not. Age of Consent laws are simply feminist indoctrination in order to control the sexual marketplace. Gods forbid old women try and compete with hotter younger women. The reality is they know they can't, attraction is tied to the hallmarks of fertility, something older women simply lack. It's no surprise feminists in the early 1900s sought to have sex with younger women made illegal.
Wait, this is a real life coaster? Isn't that reversely banked turn on the green coaster super uncomfortable?
The second from the left looks hungry for light. Etoliated and greenish bottom are indicative of not getting enough light.
It’s a stretch, but the blending series by Sharon green is all about elemental magic and going thru trials. There was even a guy from a farm with earth abilities.
Vegetables in swedish is "grönsaker" which directly translates into "green stuff".
Jonny greenwood has made every soundtrack from "There will be blood" and onward!
You gotta go green(wood) mate.
Whats crazy to me is how these musical geniuses just happened come together. Imagine if Thom yorke and Jonny greenwood hadnt met, perhaps neither wouldve worked in music. What we would have missed.
Seems like youve posted quite a few unfinished games on greenlight. I highly doubt this is anything more than an attempted cashgrab.
[I think I would have liked if he kept a little of this version but toned it a little like the current version. Not sure how to put it, so heres some pictures. I think bringing the greenery a bit to life but still keeping the decaying style works.](http://imgur.com/a/vyBPu)
Alien 3 was actually a guy in a suit, but they failed horribly with the greenscreen and managed to make it look like bad cgi. Pretty impressive really.
Basically green washing
greens
We get it, you guys like green. You don't have to go and show off about it.
Caught green-handed.
No, you're right. The match itself was just okay. I don't even remember much of the in-ring stuff. Mostly just her doing heel things like ducking out of the ring and the aforementioned count out count-along. And I do think Daria is real green. I like the gimmick, but she has a lot to work on both in her character and her in-ring ability.
What is everyone's obsession with evergreen trees? I get it, wolves live in the woods, but the team is called the **Timberwolves** not the Evergreens. Let's focus on the wolf.
The Boys actually had some impressive spots. Glad that they're progressing. Action Ortiz had some moves for a big man. Lio Rush is still pretty green, but when he polishes some of those maneuvers up, they're going to look killer.
Also I landed on the green 10 feet from the hole and birdied.
Make it configurable, you can remove the green and move the whatever causes the break so that it’s different every time...
Why didn’t you add break? I always see homemade putting greens and they’re flat, but I would want to practice reading the break too.
The one I heard was that it looked like a dead crab, so the greening of Singapore was to prevent that.
That is exactly what cuckolding/wearing a green hat is. [Definition](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/cuckold)  If you are referring to the "everyone knows but the husband" part of the story, the Chinese phrase has evolved over time to simply mean cuckolding. The 'not knowing' part no longer plays a role. The current Chinese '[definition](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/绿帽子)'  A green hat describes a man's wife having sexual relations with another man. It is also known as wearing a green hat, green headscarf. It is an insulting label.
yes, I usually 'localize' phrases. The raws do say 'wearing a green hat'.
That's assuming you go green the moment you enter the trade (ie, buying the bottom).
The % will be up to your own discretion and risk management. Typically, the only time you should start putting in a trailing stop is when you are up by a significant percentage, and the stock is trending green everyday. If the stock isn't trending, a trailing stop will likely just get stopped out prematurely and incur losses.
Past 5 trades were in FB, /ES, TSLA. SPY. All green.
VHC is the only thing still keeping me green for the week.
Rice is really cheap for carbs. At my local Costco, it costs less than $10 for 25lbs of rice, which I take about 10 weeks or more (almost every meal has rice and I eat a lot of it) to finish it. Eat the rice with some ground turkey/pork/beef with some vegetables (corn, carrots, green beans, brocolli, etc), and the cost can be less than $1/meal (and filling!) and is relatively healthy.
Termites eat the wires/cellulose sticks which makes the green ball fall out of the tube. If you don’t see the ball in the tube anymore, then you know you’ve got a problem!

As you don't need an unlock, then that should be fine.  To check, go to Cydia. If there's green text at the top saying "SHSH blobs have been saved for this device for 4.1", then you're fine. I can't seem to save my SHSH blobs anymore, but I'm on an iPod Touch 2G (Yes blobs can be saved on iPT2G for downgrading convenience), so I just assumed Saurik just cut off saving blobs for iPT2G and iP3G in order to cope with stress on the server. If you don't need to unlock, don't worry at all about Baseband.
Killing green dragons is such a common thing for peopke to do in runescape it almost feels 'clichè' and makes you (me) want to be different. Unfortunately, with dbones at 5k ea, it is pretty frickin' good. But yeah it is very busy; less busy if you kill the chaos tunnels ones, but fairly high defence is needed for that (:
Farms won't be around in 50+ years if we keep raising cattle as we do, not only do they require an absurd amount of water but they also produce methane, a greenhouse gas. Livestock accounts for 18 percent of greenhouse emissions, more than the combined exhaust from all transportation. Raising cows polluted more than every car, truck, ship, plane, etc combined.
Welcome to driving in Korea. I once had a friend get T-boned in an intersection because the GPS said go straight so she thought that meant the light was green. Ten seconds after pulling out of the car rental shop.
Bloody Brain or Brain Hemorrhage is usually Peachtree with Bailey's dropped in it (forms a bit of a brain looking thing as the milk curdles) and then you drip some grenadine on it. A runny nose I've seen years ago-- I don't remember it exactly but it's similar to the above, doesn't ring a bell to what you said. If I recall the recipe was vodka and maybe a mint schnapps (for the green) with the bailey's dripped in to make it snotty and and a bit thick.
Why do they call it blowing green? Cause Toledo sucks and Miami blows.
Yep that change in sound can often be hard for learners of the language at first. Recently they changed the subways announcements on the green line in Seoul to no longer say them in correct Korean pronunciation but instead they say them in a phonetic way for foreigners. So 선릉역 is pronounced Sun-Reoung Station instead of Seolleung and 왕십리역 si said more like Wang-Ship-Ri Station than Wangsimni. Guess people were getting confused.
The old green ones were truly the worst, which makes them the best.
looks about right for a campus. [Here's my university](https://i.imgur.com/oPYPbbb.png), which has a bit more green room, but also isn't in a city.
I am leveling a 5box team--currently level 26~27ish. As such I get a boat load of greens from just general leveling as well as instances (since I get all loot). I usually AH all the Monkey / Eagle / Owl / Power / Stamina / Strength / Int / Spell Dmg and I DE all the rest, but if anyone is looking for anything specific, I'll keep a note of it and send it out for you. *Horde
If you need help with bags or low level loot let me know. I run five accounts so I get an insane amount of random ass greens I wouldn't mind giving away, let alone sparing a few g here or there for some bags.
I'm using a 290 something green shield on my Resto Shaman :( Basically just my weapons and offhands holding down my ilvl
Most overpopulation theories were disproven in the mid 70s, but much like antivaccination, it some how lives on despite not having any bearing. The things that threatens our planet the most is climate change, which while can and is greatly affected by countries developing. One of the biggest points people use to point out overpopulation will be a problem is that food will be scarce. However that issue was solved just a few short years after the big 'the world is over crowded' hypothesises arose. You can read more about how wheat revolution has prevented mass starvation in much of the third world. (Here)[https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/4099523] From there the issues come down to things like overuse of fossil fuels or lack of living space, Neither of which are drastic issues unable to be solved, as renewable energy and extended battery life has made the change to green energy more and more likely to surpass fossil fuels in the near future, and there are plenty of places to live in this world, it might take some people to get over racist or other forms of biggotry but this planet is not short on space. So if food, shelter, or energy are not your reasons, can you tell me why you continue to believe in an outdated and disproved idea, much like the antivaxxers and climate change deniers?
My two favorite flavors are green apple and banana....
There are tons of rules like this that native speakers never learn. Like 'A silent e makes the preceding vowel a long vowel, or as I learned it, the silent e makes the first vowel say its name'. sale, Like, game, bane, more, mule, pete or the order of adjectives; whereas when listing adjectives they have to go in a specific order. The big green cardboard box is ok, but the green cardboard big box sounds wrong.
Yea. That means you're most likely greenblind. Welcome to deutan-hood.
What do you mean medium protanomaly green... You mean deutanomaly? Also, having **both** deutanomaly and protanomaly is even more rare. Most people only have one.
Yea, but Walgreens $6 hooch is tastes like ass while the Costco stuff doesn't. Also, get a $0.99 Arnold Palmer that is on sale for $0.50 while you're there since they're not available in my country. :(
No, that is incorrect. We have experiments which we use the Law of Gravity to explain the results as a best-explanation. There are plenty of things about gravity we don't know, but currently all the experiments and models currently support it. Its the same with Man-Made global warming. Plenty of experiments have shown X amount of green house cases (methane, CO2, etc) cause the run-away greenhouse gas effect. Models are part of that. Core Samples are part of that. Historical records are part of that. There's a lot more than models.
I mean sure publishing a weekly dev blog would be great. When was the last time EA published a weekly dev blog about the upcoming Call of Duty? Did Blizzard publish one for Overwatch before launch? Small indie devs do this because they have one to four workers and they want to insure people who donated / prepaid don't think they got conned. You don't see this with billion dollar publishers. I'll be the first to admit they could have handled the time in between the Cbts better. But I think early access games and green light has spoiled some people.
This picture strikes me as very Hong Kong. When I was there I ended up at quite a few tennis grounds or bowling greens that looked just like this.
Look on google maps. Notice how even though the Seoul Metro area is like, 25,000,000, there's still green and mountains. Look on the west coast of North Korea. Zoom in and notice how almost everything has had the trees stripped off. The east coast isn't so bad.

8 mile road in livonia, just outside of detroit is amazing for this. Go just over the speed limit and it's greens all the way.
Don't get me wrong so green and Julio are great but no where on par with moss. Maybe yalk saw 2007 but you guys might be too young to remember the late 1990s with the vikings
2003 Ohio State vs Bowling Green. Bowling green marches down the field And Cole Magner drops a TD in the end zone at the end of the game. OSU goes on to win 24-17. We beat Purdue and Northwesten that year and our only other losses were to Big Ben and Miami of Ohio. We were nationally ranked and ESPN game day came to campus for the game against Ball State.
The money is important, but it's also just that other schools are greener pastures. When Bowling Green is winning the conference, winning bit OOC games, and then we lose our coaches to Wake Forest and Syracuse?
I can call someone a cunt, say 'you are a carrot' and count to seven. When do I get my green card?
I have no idea what I am doing but I am green.
Look a lot like the [unis](http://www.dispatch.com/content/graphics/2012/11/24/fbc-bg-buffalo-11-24-art-g64kd9dk-1buffalo-bowling-green-football-jpeg-0b4e6.jpg) at my [Alma Mater, Bowling Green.](http://cdn1.sportngin.com/attachments/photo/4163/7477/00f58be9-47c6-406b-85d6-19ef20942c99.JPG)
Remember, we have green too! We beat the Giants by 21!
Not really at all applicable in this case. He was trying to say because one ideology of communism didn't work, no branches of it do. Because Granny Smith apples are green, all apples are green. That is a better example of what he's basically saying.
The best strategy is to not do the little green man at all and then use the rules for exciting things, like rules that are actually fun or funny.
Little green man is a terrible rule and in no way adds to the enjoyment of the game.
Its very similar, but as someone who went to uni at bowling green, I can assure you, most of Toledo has a great lakes accent.
Please tell me you made up those names. Jen green sounds real, but Billy Bobby?
Yea, I don't think SF will succumb to that either, but I wouldn't rule it out. I honestly have never been sold on Kap. I know he torched green bays grandpa defense, but in games against good defenses he didn't do much (Seattle, Baltimore)
Lime. Why have lemon AND lime. Get rid of one and bring back green apple. Thank god the skittles here in Asia have green apple instead of lime.
I'm 25. Started off with a sore throat. Get like just normal tonsillitis or maybe strep. Went to a clinic. Doc said tonsillitis, gave me some pills and sent me on my way. Next day though felt worse. Drooling all over, a building fever, couldn't open my mouth, and I had to breathe through my nose because my mouth was so blocked up. I was coughing up green goo and it felt like I had glass shards where my Adams apple used to be. Yea, I had never heard of epiglottitis before. Hope I never hear of it again. In the immortal words of Tyrion Lannister, "I like living"
We don't... Goddam selfish greener grass!
I meant on Jagex's end. They probably just have one guy to make sure the light on the server is green and that's it, cause I don't think they maintain or moderate it.
Thanks for you identification. I cut the gills on #1 and it was oozing something but it was already green.
Syncing it with a live newscast is far more complex than OBS green screen.
RGB quasars you can green tint and would probably hang somewhat okay by their true1 cables
There was a picture going around here showing that the saw in the construction icon had a single green pixel in it.
I came from the Ravens game to watch you guys hopefully beat green bay to make me feel a little better I guess I should've known better
I would have to look at the individual bills but there is a legislative tactic where you name a bill something like “saving children money and giving you money” or “the green new deal” then throw in disagreeable bits that make the opposition vote against it so it can then be said the opposition is blocking legislation to save children and give you money. Could also just be that the nuts and bolts of how the bills are supposed to go about securing elections are disagreeable and therefore they vote against it.
Every time I see the Big Bang theory/young Shelton combo commercial I wonder this. Also a Kevin James show that isn’t king of queens but is him and Leah remind again? How does this get greenlit!?
You need to hit the green button on his head 3 times in a row on the Xbox version.
I never noticed that the vegetables behind Tadokoro in the OP are never the same every episode ... For instance last episode it was [~~carrots~~/green beans?](http://i.imgur.com/qnvupMS.jpg), before that it was [cauliflower](http://i.imgur.com/g4nlaOc.png), and this time it's [corn](http://imgur.com/wNt1NWY). I love this kind of trend there is in anime nowadays to change just one little thing in their OPs/EDs, it adds a nice little touch to it.
And then you realize that peanut butter isn't green and apparently the statue of liberty has a visible green hue and you're like "what?" Like me
Go into custom match, everything is unlocked there so you can find your green dot there and get rid of it.
Hello fellow colorblind person. How old were you when you learned peanut butter isn't green?
As many others pointed out in this thread, he is clearly joking. He said biggest gang north of greenland...
I get the feeling that the day after the green army is issued a form of modular MOLLE vest, several Sgt. Majors will suffer aneurysms and hypertension related illnesses... pouches, attached to pouches, upon pouches...
Yep... Haters goona hate my new lime green kicks.
It's a growers shed... they grow pot there... the bags of 19-19-19 fertilizer is what they use to grow pot... they put the bags on the wall as a vapor barrier to turn it into a green-house... that spray-painted symbol looks a lot like a pot leaf... now this is the scary part: the people who use this shed may ACTUALLY hurt you if they catch you there.
Oh aboslutely, but the name "Greens" is always going to make a lot of people think "Faslane Peace Campers"...and while the Venn Diagram of former peace campers and green MPs is almost a complete circle, there's a lot more to them than enviromental policy. But the name isn't going to help get that across to Alan from the pub darts team.
It's a suburb of Glasgow. It just happens to be an old area that got assimilated into the Glasgow Borg instead of a new place with lots of green space, curvy streets and Edinburgh accents.
There's no way Yoda is a Rangers fan. He's a little green granda who's dedicated his life to an ancient religious group.
No it doesn't mean we are all going to die, but it does certainly mean that we risk reaching "climate tipping points" at which point certain geographical effects support more climate change. Like the ice melt on Greenland for example. The albedo effect means that lots of heat is reflected from the light surface of the glaciers, but when those begin to melt, the darker surfaces absorb more heat and support more melting. We can see this already happening, so it's not a far off distant threat. Kicking the can down the road doesn't leave us with a similar problem, but later. It risks a runaway greenhosue effect. Like the planet charging us interest on the damage we've done, and out loan doesn't stay still if we refuse to make payments til 2050. We'll also be seeing the sustained death of the coral reefs through coral bleaching and South Pacific nations like Tuvalu and Kiribati all but abandoned by 2050 due to the rising sea levels (again, all things that are happening now) while we're still begging multinational companies to behave. It's too big to rely on "the market" to solve.
Maybe *not* have three green-based kits...
It's cheaper to make them from paper, so they're only doing it to save money and taking some green pats on the back on the way.
They're catchy as Hell though. "Gimmie the green light..."
They had to highten security at his Aberdeen golf resort becuase Scots kept shitting on his greens. Makes me proud to be Scottish! Something as daft as a ban wont stop us up here protesting.

There's a *veeeeery* slight green tinge to the image due to the way mirrors don't reflect all green light.
I was slightly sad to see that ridiculous solid-green flag go; although it obviously had to lol
It's not as world-endingly environmentally devastating as your typical Angry Vegan makes it out to be. It has it's benefits too. If we didn't have all this cattle to feed, then there would be a whole lot of waste products from the food industry that we'd need to get rid of, instead we feed it to cattle who turn it into useful natural fertilisers and delicious steak. The greenhouse gas issue is a major problem, as livestock account for more emissions than all the worlds cars, planes, boats and trains combined. I think they should be looking at ways to collect this.
I appreciate that, but I think you're looking too much into the title of the post to be honest...it was a just little bit of a joke and a sly dig at the WBC. ^^You ^^can't ^^say ^^anything ^^on ^^this ^^sub ^^without ^^*someone* ^^picking ^^it ^^apart ^^to ^^find ^^some ^^sort ^^of ^^fault. ^^This ^^week ^^I ^^was ^^told ^^I ^^shouldn't ^^use ^^the ^^colour ^^green ^^to ^^represent ^^land!
I expect the SNP will definitely get the majority of Scottish seat, and possibly even dominate. My party, the Scottish Greens, I think won't move a whole lot as green voters are voting SNP in this election and keeping their Green for Holyrood. At the very least, I'd like to see my own constituency (W Dunbartonshire) finally let go of Labour and give SNP a shot instead.
Well, we'll have a look and see if green politics can actually work in real life with out very own living experiment, Greece.
Yes. And the green traffic lights are caged up too, so as to stop people smashing them in a flute-playing rage.
Morton ~~are~~ were a good side, Celtic underestimated them and paid the price. There's no chance of going into a Celtic v Rangers game that either team will underestimate the other, or the importance of performing on the day. So it's a different story I think. Both Celtic and Rangers will be up for this, along with both sets of fans; and in that situation, the only winner wears green.
How can you put that in a Nekusar EDH deck when its green? Am I missing something?
Yes! I've made people look green too, and fire... apparently fire is also not green. Tooootally released that vid before anyone told me, but I was still in university so you are meant to fuck up.
The program does differentiate a lot of the time. When I type 'ya' instead of 'ja', it gives the green light and says I made a typo. When I forget an umlaut, it notes it but still passes me. I would imagine applet would also pass. On the other hand, I understand the app works very symmetrically, as in I'm sure the english-german and german-english modules are almost identical. I would expect to get this wrong if I WAS learning English. It was more so that I was just embarrassed of the mistake. :-)
We tried that too. They just were stained green.
I’ve printed tons of stuff. Some useful (brackets to fix a lamp and hangers for artwork to name a few) and a LOT decorative/fun stuff. Like others have said, lots of D&amp;D minis and props, all sorts of flexible animals, and I’m currently printing the green parts of a Kermit the Frog. Yesterday I spent all day printing [these Oreo boxes](https://i.imgur.com/MiOy8wT.jpg) for my daughter and her friends.
Same here. This is my first and only paint job. Printed in the green and thought I’d try painting the rest. I’ll stick to plain prints folks now on. lol
Depends on when you're going to turn them. If you want to turn them while green there's nothing you need to do but turn it, then pack it up to dry. I'm no expert, but if you want to turn them later you'll need to dry them slowly by sealing them up. I Googled [an article](http://www.wood-database.com/wood-articles/drying-wood-at-home/) that should help.
There's only one way to find out for sure! Chuck it up! I snagged a bit of Crape Myrtle and wasn't sure about it, but it's looking nice! Still too green to finish but the grain is nice.
He has a shotgun that shoots the same amount of pellets as the number of pumps. The 1911 does sound up my alley. When you said propane, do you mean the green gas? How much would you be looking for for those guns? I can talk to my fan and see if they'd want to go in together for his birthday.
I am colorblind and TIL Roger is green...
Also https://corridordigital.store/products/emergency-green-screen-tee
I'm colourblind and I thought the bread was green. I was so confused for 5 minutes until I saw what sub this is
im colourblind so im probably wrong, but is the dough green?
thanks! im colourblind so its good to hear that its not green!
Im a protan and cant really see the greenness either
vsauce says its green
I am freezing. My shivering arms collapse against themselves, desperate for warmth. There are others around me suffering all the same, but we are each confined to our own cell, forced to survive on our own. I start to fidget with the few belongings I have - a decent way to pass the time - when a man peers into my cage and speaks directly towards me. "Mr. Lewis? Sorry to interrupt you, but your intern's here. I brought her up," he says, turning his head to address the small, timid-looking girl behind him. "This is Shane Lewis, you'll be shadowing him for the rest of the summer. I'll let you two get acquainted; I'm sure he's got a lot of work for you to do." "Thanks, Mr. Lee." My heart stops. Some time between seeing her face and hearing her voice, I'm not exactly sure when. I... I know this girl. I don't know how or why I do, but I know her. Her gentle, green eyes. Her small, charming smile. The tone of her voice. Even the freckles on her face. God dammit, I know I sound like a creep, but I *definitely* know this girl! I blink a few times and Mr. Lee is already gone, and this... this girl starts approaching me with her arm held out. What do you want? A handshake? Can't you see I'm having a bit of a crisis here? Like a reflex, my arm shoots out and accepts her greeting; her hand is warm to the touch, almost obnoxiously so. "Hi, Shane Lewis, but you can just call me Shane. I assume you must be Abigail?" There's a slight tremor in my voice as I speak; the words are coming out of my mouth so fast they start to jumble together. She must be aware of it because her smile keeps getting more and more apparent. Why am I so nervous around her? Yea, she's cute and all, but I never let something like that get to me before. What the hell is wrong with me...? "Yes, that's me. A bit cold in here, isn't it?" I can't help but smile as we shake hands. "That's exactly what I was thinking! I don't understand why they need to crank the AC so high in this place." "Yea, it's like they want you-" "It's almost like they want us-" "-to suffer," we say in unison, our sentences overlapping. My hand is still glued to hers, subconsciously enjoying her warmth. Her eyes are peering through mine, as if she could see into my soul... and I let her. She's supposed to be my intern. Why is this happening? I clear my throat and slip my hand away from hers, turning back towards my computer, back to reality. "Let me just get your documents sorted out and printed so that you can start working on something. Typically, we have our interns sign a couple of forms before we have you work on any of our projects. Did someone set you up with a company email? If you don't have a laptop with you, I can talk to the IT department and get you one by the end of-" "I brought my own," she says, stopping me in my tracks, gaining control of the conversation once more. She takes an office chair from one of the empty cubicles nearby and sits beside me with her laptop out. Her elbow is brushing against mine, and I am trapped in my own cubicle. "Think you can show me what I need to do?" I take a few silent breaths and lean over towards her laptop. She doesn't move an inch. "Sure... I'll have you log in to the company website. You should be able to access everything from there, including all the forms you need to sign, some standard tests you need to take, a list of-" She starts giggling and my sentence trails off as I look at her. She is covering her lips with her fingers. There are tears forming in her eyes, but I don't think it's from laughter. "What's wrong? Are you okay?" I ask, unable to understand the situation. "I'm sorry, I'm sorry," she replies, forcing herself to regain composure as I sit there dumbfounded. "It's just... you always talk a lot when you're nervous." My eyes light up. I want to cry, but I don't know why. "I know you... don't I..." She presses her lips together and nods, hiding a smile. "It's been a while..." she says softly, almost like a whisper, as if we were hiding a secret from the rest of the world. My body is frozen. But a fire lights up within me.
"Hello, Dami! Wake up!" My cheek nuzzles against a soft, fuzzy fabric resting on top of a hard surface. This is no mattress. It feels harder - like wood. No, definitely wood. Where's my bed? What's that voice I hear in the back of my head? It sounds familiar, but much softer than I what I remember... My eyes struggle to open, and my body struggles even more just to move, as if I had a severe lack of sleep the night before. "The Great Deku Tree wants to talk to you! Dami, wake up!" How does she know my name? I muster up just enough strength in my body to get up slightly and turn my head. A giant ball of light shines in the corner of my eye. I am surrounded by wooden furniture in a circular room with only one door leading outside. My heart starts pounding. This is all too familiar and unfamiliar at the same time. **I *know* this place.** Before I can gather any more of my thoughts, the ball of light speaks again, my body still lying motionless on this foreign bedding. "Hey! C'mon! Can Hyrule's destiny really depend on such a lazy boy?" Hyrule... Then it's true. This is the Legend of Zelda. Ocarina of Time. ***What the fuck am I doing here?!*** My mouth hangs open, not a word escaping it as I attempt to sit up straight in my bed. I stare blankly at this fairy, and I already know the gist of what she's going to tell me. "You finally woke up! I'm -" Navi... "- Navi the fairy! The Great Deku Tree asked me to be your partner from now on! Nice to meet you!" I still cannot control this urgent feeling growing inside my chest. My hands tremble on the bed as I subconsciously nod in return. "N-Nice to meet you too...?" Shit, Link doesn't even talk in this game. Did I already fuck it up? "The Great Deku Tree has summoned you! So let's get going, right now!" And off she goes, hovering next to the front door, expecting me to take my first steps out into Kokiri Forest. To do what? Embark on an epic journey to save the land of Hyrule? I look down and notice that I'm even dressed in his clothing. Suddenly, the rest of my senses kick in and I am overwhelmed by the atmosphere. Outside, I can hear the chirpings of insects and even the chatter of children if I listen close enough. Inside, I can see every detail of Link's Treehouse. For a moment, I consider myself extremely lucky to have the opportunity to see Kokiri Forest and all of Hyrule in full definition! My eyes and ears light up for just that moment. Once I realize that Navi is still waiting for me, I am brought back to the reality that this is much more than a simple 'HD rendering' of the game. This is real. There is no happy music playing in the background, cheering me on. I don't have a health bar or an item menu. I don't even have a sword or shield yet! No wait, I get those later on... But still, most importantly... I am *not* Link. I take a few deep breaths, acclimating myself to this new environment. If this really is the Legend of Zelda, then it will be pointless trying to find anything else out from any of the NPCs. Especially Navi. God, I really didn't think she talked like that *all* the time. But she's waiting for me. In fact... isn't all of Hyrule waiting for me? Shit. What the hell am I in for? As much as I'd love to see the rest of this world the way it is, if this is a dream, I'd much rather wake up. I shut my eyes tight for a moment and thin my lips in anticipation. I open them. Dread follows. And maybe a bit of excitement. Maybe. She's still waiting. "C'mon Dami! He's not going to wait forever!" "Isn't he a tree?" "Well... just c'mon!" I take my last deep breath and force myself upright. My footsteps make loud creaking noises underneath me as I make my way towards the front door. The sun greets my weary eyes as I take in the absolutely stunning view of the entire village. In the next few seconds, I see a girl with peculiar green hair running up to me, waving. *Saria.* Except... she looks like a real person. Is this really happening? "Yahoo! Hi, Dami!" My body motions forward a bit more and I notice the ladder in front of me. A few flashbacks of the game swim through my head. Normally, as Link, I'd just jump off. Or for style points, backflip off. Who the hell takes the ladder going down anyways? But now... now I see things from an entirely new perspective. My own. And my perspective just happens to be afraid of heights. I uneasily fixate myself on the rickety wooden ladder and follow the rungs downward, trying not to look. If Hyrule's destiny really depends on me... ...Then this might take a while... * Part 2 coming up later, let me know if you want it. I've got a lot of time on my hands today.
Ok! I just got a bit worried when they've been full sized but green for over a month!
So I have a question for you: I am growing them and I have a ton of green ones but I feel they have been green for AGES is that normal? Do they need more light or fertilizer?
Twin cities is super nice. Very green. Very friendly. Cost of living is reasonable too.
I'm colorblind so I thought peanut butter was bright green so I never ate it and now as an adult I dislike it quite strongly.
I just think that green text is the funniest of them all
It's a fucking greentext you retard.
A natural 20 on a skill check doesn't mean that he succeeds in persuading the dragon, only that he does as well as he possibly could. He might make the dragon pause for a moment to consider his argument, giving it disadvantage to attacks against him for a round. In contrast, if he rolls a 1 he might infuriate the dragon and give it advantage against him instead. He's certainly never going to convert a green dragon to Bahamut, but if he's using his entire action on this you could give him the chance to accomplish something, even if it's minor. Dodging would be a better use of his time, but at least he doesn't feel entirely shut down.
I think Batman might be able to see the same thing Amadeus Cho did, that even when enraged Banner doesn't allow Hulk to kill. Fighting would only make him madder, so he stands there and lets Hulk do as he pleases. The green giant buries him in rubble, but he lives, signals the batplane and gets the hell out.
Yoda has a lot more executive experience, and Bruce risks destroying his entire establishment. The little green takes it.
Obviously my guys aren't going to stand a chance without prepping to their fullest. Fortunately, Doom is very experienced in stealing omnipotence, and with this team behind him they won't have to break a sweat. Like I said, Infinity Gauntlets for all. With a green lantern ring on each finger, just for funsies.

Bullshit. This photo graced the cover of National Geographic in 1985. The photographer has since gone back and foudn the same woman and taken additional photos of her after 17 years. "The portrait by Steve McCurry turned out to be one of those images that sears the heart, and in June 1985 it ran on the cover of this magazine. Her eyes are sea green. They are haunted and haunting, and in them you can read the tragedy of a land drained by war. She became known around National Geographic as the "Afghan girl," and for 17 years no one knew her name."

Thats why luke skywalkers lightsaber was green in episode 6, so you could see it against the sky.
Lime green camo all the way!
Most of the Norwegian scenes are like that. Doesn't look like Norway at all. The cliff scene with Odin is on a green screen and they couldn't be arsed to get a shot of Norway to lay on the background like really.
Maybe im misunderstanding what a self is but I will try.  * Does you think your country lack a sense of self in any ways? No, i think we have a sense of self because we have history and common things to gather around. Be it politics, events, language, shows and history.  * Do you think that every country has a sense of self in some way? Yes, sometimes we share interest but i share interest with lots of people doesn't make me less of an individual. * Do you agree with my assertion that the United States is deprived of any sense of self? No, you are a young country but you as a country as a unit shares the same things we do, a language, history, events, shows, politics and so on. Just because your language isn't purely of your own making doesn't make any difference it just another feature that makes you different from the rest and separate yourself into your own thing. For a country of your size you are homogeneous as all hell. Doesn't that speak to a unified and proof of a self on its own? Americans seem obsessed with heritages and other cultures. I think its just a case of thinking the grass is greener on the other side. You don't see your own self because to you its just day to day life while ours seem all foreign and exotic.
Of course a danish artist would claim iceland, greenland and faraoes are danish. Those were rightfull norwegian clay and denmark went all greedy and kept them when we got traded off to sweden as spoils of war. #Neverforgivetheflatlandthieves
They don't really. It's just "news about sweden and denmark" not "News about the country that stole us from denmark as spoils of war!" or "New about denmark, the one that held down Norway from being a nation of it's own for 400 years!" And they lost us like 200 years ago, time to let go, also give greenland back.

The green one is my cocain. Soo good.
Maybe environmentalists should focus on oil and coal instead of clean nuclear. Nuclear is dangerous if it fails(the few times it's happened) but coal and oil is even more dangerous by polluting in both radiation and harmful gasses than nuclear is just by being on and then include the fun of being dangerous if it goes bad; which often happens even before it gets to the plant like death in coal mines, transport of oil, burst pipelines, BPP oil spill.. i could go on. Going green is all well but if they stop with nuclear where do they think they turn to when they wait for their renewable sources to get up and running?

My mother's family is from New Mexico. One time I forgot to wear gloves when peeling roasted green chile. I was told to submerge my hands in canola oil. Capsaicin is oil-soluble, apparently.
Not bullshit. Two of our three cones have relatively high sensativity to the wavelength of green light so we're more sensative to it. It's likely due to it helping us identify food sources better.
Not bullshit. Mythbusters tested this in one of their earlier episodes when they were testing if talking to plants works. The greenhouses without anything playing did the poorest. The ones that had classical playing did better than talking but the best was death metal.
She's either thinking of the old myth that the green leafy part is poisonous or she's mistaking them for potatoes where the green parts actually are poisonous because they develop solanine along with chlorophyll when exposed to sunlight unlike carrots.
Bullshit. It's usually because they were somehow exposed to sunlight. The green is actually chlorophyll and should be bitter. Nutrient deficiencies and environmental changes can also cause it.
I started reading and now I'm invested. Where's the rest of that greentext?
That use to be one of the things I hated the most about searching for music online but luckily it seems like it's easier to avoid those now. Pretty sure it's the online equivalent of showing off at guitar center. What's really confusing is the fans of the bigger Youtube channels that only cover songs. There was one I stumbled on recently with some girl cosplaying while covering metal songs. The videos were higher quality than most since she took the time to stand in front of green screened backgrounds, record it properly and even matched the guitar tone pretty well instead of just using the microphone on the camera but it was still the actual song with her guitar playing over it. She was selling merch which is strange to begin with for someone that's getting attention using others work but even weirder was that her fans were buying a lot of it. They even made fanart, a sculpture, and someone made a cake version of her. Looking back on it, I might have just stumbled into a weeaboo cult.

Around the time that Terminator 2 was released, there were a bunch of movies where a single actor played the role of twins using a green screen so it was easy to dismiss.
Doesn't the green part apply to the person who made the image too?
They all varies pretty wildly between stores. I prefer Dr. Thunder over Dr. Pepper and I find Walgreens brand fruity soda is too sweet and tastes like melted hard candy.
I'm having a hard time believing that you're not downvoting me considering how quick that's happening.

I used to see it pretty often in the Kmart in Penn Station, in a Duane Reade across the street from the empire state building, and in a Walgreen's that is at the bottom of the empire state building. I haven't been in any of these stores in a few months but they might still have them.
Fresh after a filtration, the solution is as your describe but over the course of a week or two of evaporation the solution slowly takes on a VERY slight green cast that is really only noticed during the next filtration - I suppose I could also just perform more frequent filtrations too, but I'm kinda lazy and forgetful :-P I'm on the 3rd and probably last copper sulfate crystal so a recrystallization would probably eat up too much of the last of my solute - the 2nd one did have more 2ndaries than my 1st, I just didn't connect the two occurrences
I love these cars. But so many people don't like them. They are also fast considering their weight! You can also fit 3 dogs in the back comfortably with space for 4 people and their luggage. I had a lime green one!
Wow, that's an awesome tip! I've lost countless primaries to the trees switching between them when dropping them on the ground. I'll make sure I keep a green axe on me at all times! :D
Exactly this. Most of the world is a very green place. Unless you live in a highly populated area,
As someone who grew up working on farms bailing hay, working cattle. Then moved into construction working shift work as a Rigger.

The IT roles don’t end, the phone rings, things break, the expectations from management are extreme, but the worst part? There’s no unions. I have seen both sides of the fence and while the grass always looks greener, I can tell you it looks a lot greener in a physical role where you get to go home at night.

If you'd like something similar you can try [Mono-Green Infect](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/18-06-14-mono-green-infect/) without the Inkmoth Nexus. Never played it but it would probably play similarly, and If you decided you liked it you could work into building UG Infect.
Something something green demotes/f2p units since launch something something...
I hate it so much that they always do things like recommending steady breath for this because "well his defence is better than his resistance, lets make it even better", yah sure let me just make a unit with a glaring weakness, letting him get completely destroyed by a Nino or any other green mage, making his distant counter weapon a complete waste. Absolutely terrible build suggestions.
Nino is good without buffs, and since you're a f2p player Nino is possibly the best choice you could make for green units as she's easy to get good IV's &amp; merges for. Also, a simple Hone Attack 3 affecting your Nino is a 16 damage increase (assuming she doubles, which she will do to a vast majority of units), so you can always get one of those for someone off of a 4* Olivia/F!Corrin/Mathilda.
Live on the green EDIT: After reading they call it a "Concert Series" which I think is more fitting
Thank you very much for the complete and detailed answer. Around the age of 13, i learned how to control my dreams (Lucid dreaming). At this stage i was able to have conscious conversations with Alice, this is around the time we began a romantic relationship, and really began to fall in love. Because i was 13, this is the first time i truly felt in love, and still haven't felt like that towards any real living girl. She would give me advice for real life, and even waking relationships. During this particular dream i didn't have complete control though, i could control some of my reactions, but no one else's. First off, i thought Alice may be a real person, or at least the image of someone i would meet in the future because that has happened before. Before my first day in a new school, i had a very long dream, where me and some people i had never seen before did things like water slides, amusement parks ETC. Later in that year a met almost all of the people from that dream, and did every one of the activities the exact way we did it in the dream, but that is a different story i could go into deeply. (i use religion to explain this, because from my research, you cant dream of someone you haven't seen before) I have been pondering the disease and tingling since i woke up. Me and Alice had touched many times before, whether it be kissing, hugging or anything flirtatious or playing (when we were younger), all of those gave me a different tingling, a sort of happy one that made me feel at peace. We had never touched in any truly hostile way, I think that may be a factor, this was the first time she pushed me away. I also saw the green disease spreading through my skin and had already seen the horrors it brings, Thats why i jumped. I think this may symbolize some kind of bad idea that may be infiltrating my mind, because i have been going through a lot of interpersonal changes lately. I use Alice as a "Template" for my relationships in real life. Im a writer (as a hobby, i'm 16 i have no job), so i also use her as a guide for all my female characters or Love interests. Thank you again for the complete answer, you seem to be a very knowledgable person in this area, anywhere i can read and learn more on the topic? expect to hear more from me. EDIT: Details
draw a picture of a large green llama, battling an army of magical evil platypi on a mountian top, if you can draw it ill be impressed
The walls of the greenhouse and other junk that can't be moved don't actually count against you when growing fruit tree fruit, they'll grow regardless.
Yeah I've never been a fan of downtown Amsterdam, but I do really like the [side-ish streets.](http://i.imgur.com/EB9GEtA.png) I think it's the greenery that really makes a difference.
You could shoot the animation with a solid green background then chroma key it out and lay it on your photo/video. I don't know how good it will look though.
Yup, colour-blind here. I thought the bottom wire was green but it's not. Although, rather than really helping the colour-blind (which it does), I think it's an indication for when setting it up/repairing of what goes where.
Hahaha, Chomsky developed the idea of not caring one bit for meaning when studying language because "colourless green ideas sleep furiously" is a grammatical sentence but doesn't mean anything. I know what you're thinking: "wait, that approach is bullshit!" And it is

Ah yes the ole get people to sign papers so I don't lose my little green papers.
I just used this one today. Department meeting, manager was talking about keeping our stats in the green. My response...Supergreen -- Fifth Element
I think the fault ultimately lies in the direction... my personal opinion is that the many green screens didn't help with the immersion. In the third one though you cant tell everyone was more comfortable in their roles tho.
Ah yeah it's just green for me
Ah, the old flashing green light. Massachusetts is insane
It's not live yet. I don't think the green is actually at 1:30 exactly
There was no way they could have let it go green all the way around, there was a huge piece of debris sitting in the middle of the frontstretch
Cool program. I knew that guy was from Maryland but didn't realize he was a NASCAR fan. That clip of him waving the green flag at Fontana must be one of the weakest green flag waves I've ever seen lol
Oh, yeah. I can't see threads if they're in green apparently.
That grass is so green.
Would this work? I feel like the rubber from the tires hitting the wall would cover up any green paint that was exposed.
The ARCA cars are basically old Gen4 NASCAR cars. That means they don't have the safety improvements that came with the COT (Gen5) such as foam in the doors, larger "greenhouse", more centrally placed seat, etc. However, they are racing on tracks with SAFER barriers, and I assume the drivers use HANS devices-- both of these were not true in NASCAR during the pre-2002 era when more drivers were getting seriously hurt. TL;DR: ARCA cars are less safe than Cup cars, but injuries are always possible in racing. His was a very hard impact and it's impossible to say whether his injury would have been prevented by a more modern race car.
You see that green sign on the wall at the upper-right corner of the screen at 0:28? YOU GET OUT OF THE CAR AND FOLLOW IT
I think you hit the nail on the head with the debris cautions. Even before we had the lucky dog rule, people were getting their lap back by passing the leader before the S/F line ("gentlemen's agreement"). A big difference now is that there are just way more cautions (as the Racingnomics guy has shown). The Atlanta race is a good example of an exception to the rule-- for once, we had a race that mostly went green, and as a result, there were a lot more lapped cars.
The next time you ride the green line, sit in the front of the train and look out the windshield. Under the conditions you describe, you will likely discover that the reason the train isn't going any faster is that there's another train in front of it. The Green Line (central subway) is just like a highway: When too many cars (trains) try to use it at the same time, everyone has to slow down.
I read that image as saying that the parking is all underground, with the green space on top of it serving as a park. Going back and re-reading, it looks like they want you to park underground and bring your tailgating gear upstairs to the park.
AFAIK it's like this now: * B line goes to Park St * C line goes to North Station * D line goes to Gov't Ctr * E line goes to Lechmere. I don't know how well the new electronic signs are able to reflect that, and you may have to wait a while for an E train. In theory, more and/or different trains will go to Lechmere when the green line extension opens, but who knows if that will ever happen. Edit: The signs may be having a bit of trouble at Copley inbound since the E (Lechmere-bound) trains are coming from a different track than all the others, and the sign probably doesn't know which way the switch (located just outside the station) is pointing. So you might see a B, C, or D train appearing to jump in front of an E train in the order.
Atlanta green flag should be at roughly 10:16 AM Pacific this weekend FYI.
Green race cars are bad luck though. That's why you never see a green car winning the championship
Not technically in Boston, but I nominate the intersection of 28, Cambridge St, East St, and the Lechmere busway in Cambridge (underneath the elevated green line tracks).
Depends on where you are. Downtown and the northern parts of Bochum are pretty ugly (Although it is one of the more pleasant cities of the Ruhrgebiet, imho) - But once you reach the outskirts it actually becomes quite nice to live. I live in the southernmost part of the city, near the university, where we have a lot of green areas. (The Ruhr University itself is ugly as hell - but take a trip to Kemnader See from there and you'll find an awesome place to have a nice day!) It's not a city where I want to stay my whole life, but it's better than I ever would have imagined.
Ever heard of the veil of ignorance? This idea says that people should make political decisions without knowing which place in society they would end up in. John Rawls came up with this "Original Position", which basically implies yoy should ignore your own place in society and the views that come with it. I believe many people vote according to what's best for (the biggest part) of their entire society, and so follow the principle of the Veil of Ignorance. An example is green parties: people who might get a windmill in their back yard might still vote for green parties, just because they think durability might be best (and not just for them) on the long run.
I'd say that right now, you're simply adressing the viewpoints of populists. What you say is true, but goes for any viewpoint and any kind of politics. If suddenly, Kim Jong-Un decided to actually give his people food, we'd agree with that although we don't like his methods of ruling. If populists decide to ban anything that emits greenhouse gases, you would agree with if you were an environmentalist. That doesn't really have anything to do with populism, though.
They don't call him green for nothing
Totally wrong sorry. Broccoli is just another term for weed, nothing to do with green smoke or it looking like puffs. Broccoli by D.R.A.M. made the term popular.
I thought something similar to the transparent green would be cool, like a metallic light green
Temporarily, yeah, but it'll rebound once their green energy business takes off.
I know what it's not. It's not cricket on the green or village fetes. Though those are a small part. It's tolerance, we were up until now tolerant of others. Respectful and polite. Now that's out the window.
No it was a small lump of green putty.
Depends how you look at it. I'm currently paying around £900pcm for a mortgage on a 3 bed semi, my previous place - a 2 bed flat - I lived went on the rental market recently for £895pcm. Currently my interest rate on my mortgage is about 4.7%, house prices are rising at 7% or so in my area, if that continues, when I finish paying my mortgage, my house will be worth more than the total sum I paid off including interest. Advantages of buying: * It's yours, you can do whatever you like, paint the walls lime green if you want, need extra room, extend. * It's an investment in land and property, though like all investments there are risks Disadvantages of buying: * If things go wrong, you have to get it fixed, however... There are 'home emergency' insurances available to fix plumbing, electrics, etc, and buildings and contents will take care of a lot of things. On my home insurance it was about £3 a month extra to get home emergency cover, and we've used it twice already for plumbing problems. * It's expensive at the beginning. Nobody tells you just how much it'll cost, yes you need a deposit (5%-10%) and the fees, etc, but then there's the first mortgage payment which may be a lot more than you imagined as it includes interest from the day you completed. So if you complete on the 2nd April and your first mortgage payment comes out on the 1st May, then you will be paying all of April's interest on your first payment as well as the interest due in May!

I'd love to do a self-build, but land is expensive and rare around here. I'm in the home counties, green belt. Developers snap up any available land faster than anyone else could, and self-build isn't necessarily cheaper is it?

I'm playing Bali Hai at the end of June. I've played Paiute before and it was great, but it was very very windy to the point of frustration since its so wide open. We chose Bali Hai this time because after you factor in the time/money to get to the courses away from downtown, the $130 greens fee we got for Bali Hai doesn't seem so bad.
[Had a good round over the weekend, +6.](http://imgur.com/a/AoYpU) Hitting 11/13 fairways is great, but only 10/18 greens needs some work.
My into golf story starts before I was even born when my dad was growing up at military bases and didn't have much money. He had a knee injury that kept him from playing contact sports so he started playing golf. Fast forward to when I was 5 he really had emphasis on quality time spent together on the golf course. Even though I didn't like going to the course every weekend when I was 5 it was the best thing to ever happen to me. Now that my dad is getting older and we don't have too much time together since we live across the country, those 4 hours that I get on the golf course with him when I visit are invaluable. I remember a time I was probably 9 years old we were on the 9th hole of our local course, late in the afternoon so we both hit a few approach shots into the green. All 6 were anywhere from 3-40 feet from the hole. For fun my dad said if I sank all of the, he would give me $100. Much to his dismay I sunk all the putts and from that point on i haven't put a club down. I now volunteer with the first tee program and can't wait to share these golf memories with my children (whenever that happens!) Thanks for doing the AMA!
I was about 8 years old and playing with my dad. We were on the 9th hole and we had hit a few balls up to the green when he says if I can make all 4 putts (varying length between 5-20 feet) that he will give me $50. He would always tell me to "smooth it" while I was putting too reinforce a nice swing. Well much to his dismay I made all 4 and now "smooth it" is stamped on my putter. That'll always stay with me.
I’m colorblind and didn’t realize they were supposed to be green. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
Well the good news is you at least know some things that you should work on! Approach shot accuracy can help you get closer to the pin, making your putting life easier, then work on those longer distance putts to help you putt just once to hole out, rather than putt two or three times. I say this because your approach shots and single putts are what make birdies. A GIR and a single putt means at least birdie on any hole; the exceptions being if you manage to drive a shorter par 4, or get to the green in 2 on a par five, then you can still putt twice for birdie. Easier said than done, I know. I've had two putt opportunities for eagle. I par'd one, and bogeyed the other. Yes, that's a three putt and a four putt. Those were dark times.
Here's how I practice: First, I putt from the center of the green (ish) to the fringe to get a feel for the speed of the green. It just helps you get a feel for how far the ball will roll based on hard you hit it. A game you can do is to try to always make your next ball land between your last ball and the fringe. Next, I practice the three to five foot putts that are straight and level, to build confidence and to dial in my stroke. After that I just practice longer and longer putts, in more crazy parts of the green. Don't forget to practice putting from the fringe or beyond! You'd be shocked at how far away from the green you can be and still putt the ball. It's generally safer than chipping. Next I practice my chipping and pitching, because I suck at hitting greens with my iron shots. I'm getting better, but GIR's still only happen like 3-5 times per 18 holes.
You all need to remember some things, though: hours for that job suck. They suck so much ass it isn't even funny. Almost all of your turf management duties must happen when no one is playing golf at the time. This means very very early mornings, and typically some late nights as well for special projects. Have a major tournament coming through? You better sleep when and where you can. The players just fucked up your greens and turf, and you need to set a new hole location on the green for tomorrow's round? Hope you're a night owl. The same goes for turf management regarding any sport, really. During baseball season you will be working some long, long days to keep the turf up to snuff. Mornings, then the game happens, then you'll be there cleaning things up until 11 or 12 at night. You also can't forget the pressure behind this line of work. Failing at your job is obvious to everyone, and you will feel those consequences. It's a constant battle against mother nature with very public consequences for failure.
^ What this guy said. Typically with a 3 wood, you know your distance on it, and use it to reach that certain distance, leading to a more controlled and slower swing. When people grab their driver, typically all they care about is aiming in a direction and smacking the living hell out of a ball. Focus on a controlled swing with the driver first, then add the power later. If you just focus on swinging through and hitting the ball, you'll hit better drives more often then just swinging with all your might. Personally I hit my diver much better than my 3-wood, mainly because a usable 3-wood is a new addition for me, and I rarely have opportunities to play it. If I need less reach off of the tee to avoid water or get to the curve of a dog leg or what have you, I just hit my hybrid instead. It's only about 20 or so yards less than the 3 wood, so I don't really feel the difference much. Except for that par 5 where I was just 15 yards away from the green after my second hit...I could have really used a good 3 wood then...
Lessons, unless there is some obvious club gap that you are having trouble filling with your current set. Maybe there's a distance or range of distances that really gives you trouble. I'd try and fill that with a club or two, and then spend the rest on lessons. For example, I started with a pitching wedge and a 60 degree wedge (my clubs were given to me), and I quickly noticed that I didn't have an adequate club to help me with those less than 100 yard shots. I grabbed a 52 degree wedge to fill the gap and it's become one of my favorite go-to clubs. It doesn't seem to come up short like my 60, and my balls don't come in low and roll off the green like they do with my P, so it fits me and my swing. If you don't have a gap like that, I'd start with lessons instead, and then who knows, maybe you'd find a gap to fill afterwards.
I think a lot of folks are really forgetting about the home course advantage here. Who knows how many years this guy has spent being a member at Augusta, learning every angle and trick he could to score better on the course. He's haed to the green speed and style, knows what to avoid, etc. Meanwhile the pros have to practice so many different styles of courses, Augusta is just one more on their list, not the end all be all.
Seconded. It's actually annoying advice, to work on your short game more, when we all know the short game comes last on every hole. It's impossible for me to care about short game if my drives and long irons are inconsistent garbage. I'm just now starting to consistently drive the ball well, and let me tell you, it feels fantastic to get to a green in two strokes with a drive and short iron when I could never do it before. But the only thing that helped was actually going to the range with the sole focus of practicing my drive. The long irons were semi resolved by just buying hybrids instead. Long irons can go eat dirt for all I care. My rescue hybrid does exactly that...rescues me and saves my ass. The short game has no real value until you can get to the green semi consistently without hitting the ball 100 yards at a time over the river and through the woods. A good short game without the long game to back it is only useful in select shot.
Not necessarily. Finally hitting a consistent drive is what brought me out of bogey level play (mostly). Being able to approach most greens with a 6 instead of a 3, or an 8 instead of a 5, all thanks to a solid drive really helped my game. I hate those longer irons, and I haven't made the jump to hybrids yet. I can still three putt with the best of them on a semi-normal day, but at least I can get to the green consistently now :)
I used to work as a produce clerk at a grocery store, and this is why some of the leafy green vegetables that can typically go limp can appear so fresh on the wall. Not only does the wet wall keep a constant mist going over them, keeping them fresh, but we soaked them all in water in the back before stocking the shelves with them. Pro-tip: if you soak a leafy veggie like celery, any sort of green, lettuce, etc, and it doesn't spring back from being limp, it's probably really old, and won't last much longer.
My go-to was always a golfball in my garage. Then I got a green biscuit training puck. That thing will slide anywhere! Also there's the traditional wooden ball you can use. Eventually you can add weight to your stick to build up those stick handling muscles, too.
Southerner here. I hate normal tomatoes, but I will eat fried green tomatoes all damn day. Also, shrimp and grits are somehow amazing. Honestly, the only thing "Southern" I've seen listed here that I didn't enjoy was pickled pigs feet, mainly because I've never eaten them. I mean, come on. It's pigs feet. I don't even like pickles, what makes you think I'll like that with a pig's foot?
Honking at people to "go" is so much easier on my motorcycle. Normally if they haven't noticed the light change to green, I just rev my throttle a bit (something motorcycles who want to show off do a lot), because most people don't associate a revved throttle to be directed at them, but it still causes them to look up. If that doesn't work, I switch to the horn, but motorcycle horns are so dainty and cute and pathetic that people are never offended by them. It's more of a tweet rather than a honk. Plus they are button operated, which allows you to easily do two quick little honks, which people seem to never be offended by. Much harder to replicate with a car horn.
Whelp, you are now tagged as Derpy Goddess. I even made the tag green since you're Kokiri and all, but I feel like you're a little old to be true, 100% Kokiri...
You ever tried to tee off with an old putter before? Now *that* can be entertaining. I had a friend amazingly roll onto the green on a short Par 3 after teeing off with an old putter. He just wanted to see what would happen. I keep saying old putter because there's no way in hell I'd do that with my normal putter. I care about it and its safety a little too much.
It's been green lighted.
Does anybody else think that Kevin and Kate are actually better friends than they both admit to? Like, I get that they’ve had drama this year, but there have been so many small moments of them genuinely enjoying each other. Like, in this episode, them shit-talking Molly and Justine outside the club, and then when he smiled at her randomly when they were talking food stuffs. Edit: and then literally the second after I post this Kevin and Kate laughing about his lil green hat
Hey, no need to shit on CW, they’re the only network to greenlight Crazy Ex Girlfriend, which is a bizarro TV Musical masterpiece.
Right? Like OP can’t do SOMETHING ELSE for less than a minute? What I do when I quit out of a match is switch apps, read a few headlines on /r/all and then switch back to the Clash Royale app. That way I get a lil break from the game, they get their cushy 3 crown, and then when I make my way back to the Clash Royale App, It loads on the screen that has a big ass green “battle” button so i can start the whole process over again.
This is so, very important. We have to make it SO clear-as-day that Congress not impeaching/removing him means Congress saying that the sky is green.
As a slightly colorblind stain, seeing those greens described as "vastly different" made me chuckle, cause to me they're basically identical
Ana De Armas eyes are fucking magical. Like, she already has near perfect features and then boom her eyes are an exceptionally rare concentrated green?? Wtf kind of genetic luck is that
Jae Crowder with a green light saber sticking out of his head?
Is it bad that I want to get a SCUBA certification just so I can dive down 40~ feet and cut my leg so I can see my green blood?
Where the green grass grows all around and around, where the green grass grows all around.
I'll have to check it out.  Anyway, it's almost as if Jeffgreenfan was completely wrong about it being a complete team!
It's 2013 folks, where a show like Chozen can get the green light.
Uh NBA Green is just what every other single "Green initiative" has been for 15 years, all about "being green", recycling, energy consumption, environmental protection and restoration, etc etc.
What program is that green cube on your dock, if you dont mind me asking?
These Celtics uniforms are so fucking green holy shit
Wait, I didn't say either way what I thought about the greenhouse fire, so why are you asking me? Anyway, He didn't tell on himself- he only told them about the fire. He had no idea he would be caught in the neighbor's house with fire stuff in a few days, too. I think he clearly DID start the fire, and then immediately regretted his decision. That's a hallmark of little kid logic, Why are you acting as if that's totally unreasonable of a kid to do? Kids are patently *illogical*, and Teddy has never once struck me as intelligent.  He wasn't going to run back to bed because he realized that the fire, whoever started it, could actually become a problem because fire back then spread like a motherfucker.
I just saw the GIF and I know enough about football to know that the fucking green dude definitely caught the fucking ball. Why would they give points to the team that didn't catch the ball..??  It's like opposite day or some shit
Where’s green? Edit: i’m colorblind, don’t kill me
*The Cloud* just means it's running off of someone else's PC. You can rent a VPS to run TeamSpeak 3 on. A VPS is a small server that you can connect to remotely, you can set up *cloud storage* or run servers, such as TeamSpeak 3. I use [OVH](https://www.ovh.co.uk/vps/vps-ssd.xml) to run my TeamSpeak3 server. It also hosts my website. I use Ubuntu 16.04 as my Operating System of choice, it's very popular and easy to use. To remote in to the VPS, when you get the IP address (from OVH it's usually in an email) you can use [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) to connect to your server. Everything is text based as this is a Command Line Interface, if you've never used one it looks scary, but there are many tutorials online, but if you need extra help I'll even make my own with images so it's basically just copy+Paste to set it up.
But didn't the Sith destroy all the Crystal mines so in Jedi he has a synthesized one instead? Or was that EU as well...? Or was the story explaining why it's green EU and now it is uncharted territory? God dammit Lucas, it was so much easier before.
Yay for green peanut butter!
I’ll be honest, I was disappointed when this was announced. But the more time goes on the more excited I am to this boy light up the field in the midnight green!
I hate to tell you this but I think you have a typo. Pretty sure his name is “Pendergreens”
Yes they're the same, good question though- I'll be looking into this a bit more to understand it better. When I wear those enchroma glasses, green grass looks more vivid than computer grass but that's just because of how the glasses work, with my normal eyes it'll all still look the same
Hah no way! I met a Heavy on a pub once who had the same cosmetic set as me, same unusual effect and everything, but it was all painted green. He was colorblind too, we became best friends :P
(Taken from his Steam greenlight page)
What is that green material you're using? I always see them when I'm buying metal minis from websites like Dark Sword. Is it wax?
I made the decision to stop eating beef after seeing Leo's documentary "Before the Flood". Its an easy enough step to take—I just replace my beef needs with turkey or chicken (which produce less greenhouse gasses per pound than beef).
That's definitely the case. The Wachowskis are very out and ostentatious with the sexuality, gender, socioeconomic, and race issues. They show eight facets of the world and then links these people together in a very intimate way. The 'thesis' of sense8 would be to show how when we can understand each other it doesn't matter how different we are, we understand that we are all the same as humans. I can fully understand how some of the imagery could be off-putting to some people. They definitely take their time with the sex scenes. The way I see it though is to normalize a varied sexuality through the show. It's like how when a song plays on the radio a bunch, you start to like it no matter what. They show non-hetero sex scenes enough times that it becomes a totally normal thing to see—desensitizes you to it. Ignoring that for a moment, the filmmaking is super cool. It's really awesome that they actually fly the cast all ofver the world to shoot all of the scenes for real, rather than faking much of it on a sound stage or with green screen. The visuals are stunning, the soundtrack is killer, the fight choreography and action blows The Matrix Trilogy out of the water.
I used to live in this building! Used to bring beers down to the putting green all the time. I was up on the 29th floor though, it made for some beautiful views
If it makes you feel even better I used to vote conservative, but got so pissed off last election I voted green, who ended up finishing 3rd in my riding. No major complaints for this current term of government
[According to this tweet from Greg Brady lol](https://twitter.com/gregbradyTO/status/968335214631104513?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.letsgoleafs.com%2Farticles%2Fthe-reason-why-mike-green-refused-a-trade-to-toron%2F). And I have no idea who he thought he was better than, that D core was insane
I remember in the last election I hated everyone in my riding so I just voted green. I'd be interested to see the Green and NDP merge, but at the same time, I don't want Canada to become like the US and only have a few major political parties. Even though it's mostly Liberal vs. Conservative, I like that there are 2 other "major" parties
Ice, clamato (used to anyway), tobasco, worchestershire (sp?), montreal steak spice, rimmer/celery salt, pepper, lemon &amp; lime squeeze, spicy pickle juice, celery stalk, and then a skewer with a pickled bean, pickled garlic, green olive and a pickle. Our family now has to do this with the "garden cocktail" because of a shellfish allergy in the family, but damn does it ever taste good still.
Just make sure you're physically green at one point and she'll be right
I doubt it, or at least I hope not. There is still plenty of space to develop within the limitations of the Greenbelt. [Link to map](http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/greenbelt/pages/501/attachments/original/1384536375/greenbelt-map.pdf?1384536375)
This is what bugs me the most. Everyone is saying there is no space unless we lift the greenbelt, when in fact [there is still plenty of room](http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/greenbelt/pages/501/attachments/original/1384536375/greenbelt-map.pdf?1384536375) for expansion. Especially in the Markham, Hamilton, Milton, Georgetown, Pickering, Ajax, Whitby, Oshawa, Courtice, Bowmanville and Newmarket areas, which are all commuter towns to Toronto already anyway. We just need to somehow motivate builders to actually develop these areas, and to keep Toronto accessibility in mind when they do so, whether that means working with cities, municipalities, transit companies, etc., when they do so.
I'd imagine cultivating crops of pot would have some barriers like capital, equipment, and even greenhouses if the climate isn't ideal. I'd say that it would be almost equally as difficult as growing wine
Because people sit on their phones or GPS and miss a green light and fuck with traffic. It's absolutely awful on long weekends with cottage traffic on one lane roads Edit: I'm drunk and at the cottage, worst part is the drive up, buncha cidiots fuck it up for the rest of us, once you're in the bush, it's heaven
I think keeping the greenbelt is a good thing. We most definitely need the farmland, and it also forces a stop to the Toronto sprawl, which would cost a fortune to expand transportation networks. I think the plan for Toronto is let it build up, let the infrastructure get to where it needs to be, and then look at expanding again.
I'm green too
I'd imagine it went like this: Tee off (1) out of bounds (2), repeat tee shot (3), out of bounds (4), break driver use fairway wood off of tee block (5), land in fairway sand trap, duff shot 3 feet into same sand trap (6), repeat (7), repeat (8), duff out of sand trap (9), break club. Slice next shot across fairway (10) land behind tree, punch too far out of fairway (11), land out of bounds (12). Shoot into sand trap around green (13), shoot onto green (14), miss 3 foot putt (15), sink tap in (16), have a legitimate stroke (17).
Mine was green... Now I question every decision I made
Implying all green text stories are real
Its gonna be really interesting when the NDP win majority with green party coming second in October
I dunno, I've been to many places in the US and I've loved every place I've been too. I find in Canada we have a lot of rocky shoreline, and a lot of lakes and forests where you guys have many different types of environments, from ocean beaches to mountains, to wide deserts and beautiful cities. Grass always seems greener on the other side I guess
Rule 2. All posts mist be screencaps of greentext written on 4chan.
The joke was that I have done that and therefore they are no longer green.
Jokes on you, I’m colourblind and my squadmates aren’t green!
I am colourblind and I have no trouble telling commons and uncommons apart at the moment. EDIT: However, epics and rares are difficult and I would probably confuse green with legendaries.
Someone should call greenpeace
My brother had a greenstick fracture to his collarbone playing Highschool football. Its probably worse than outright breaking it.
Meanwhile, "You're looking a little green."
"I hate Adon the most. He is dogmatic, unwavering, never interacts with mortals unless he is going to kill them, and he enforces the rule of a tyrant. He holds everyone to his own moral standards, which means he wants everybody to be unwaveringly loyal to Astron. He is Astron's puppet, while manipulating the council of the gods to fear him. He cares not for context in crime, and hands out death for a paladin breaking their oath without remorse or consideration. It is his fault that I am the gods greatest threat, a fact he vehemently denies. He doesn't care for the plights of the mortal races, he is as disconnected as a god can be, destroying people with his inactivity. He is not holy, like his name suggests, he is evil and ruthless, loyal only to Astron above all. If Astron commanded that he commit genocide, Adon would without hesitation, all in the name of Astron's plan." Lord Sulton is the angriest you have seen him, his voice taking on a deep growling sound, the bright green fires in his eye sockets burning harsher than before. "He is not worthy of being the god of paladins, oaths, and morals. He is not moral, he only enforces absolute law, which is static, unchanging, uncreative. My people knew this, they knew that Astron's claim to be the sole creator of the realms to be a lie, as law cannot create something, it can only preserve. It would be against Ashton's nature, but everybody believes him, and he used Adon to silence anybody who speaks out. Astron is a dictator, and Adon is a murderer in a suit. They can talk all they want about enforcing the law, and 'the greater good', but they are decieving everybody who listens."
"If you have interviewed Astron, he who creates, then you would've heard my name. I am the greatest threat to the gods they have ever known, the irony is heavy, as it is due to their own actions which caused my own undeath." He lifts off his helmet, revealing a skull with green flames in the eye sockets. "I shall not kill you, as you have not opposed me or my ultimate goal to end the gods."
The dagger lodges itself into Lord Sulthon's helmet. He lets out a deep, raspy sigh and grips he helmet. He pulls it off, and the crowd goes dead silent. Underneath the armour is a monster of bone. No flesh or skin remains on the skeleton. In his eye sockets glow bright green flames. He looks around at the crowd as they sit in uncomfortable silence. He turns his head back to his helmet and grips the dagger, pulling it out. "The match was unfair from the start. I have fought of the most powerful angels, I have slain deities. There was no way anybody could have won. Though I had hopes, this display was pathetic and weak." His deep, unholy voice echoes throughout the arena unnaturally. He puts his helmet on and leaves the arena.
That bitch had a case of the green apple splatters and painted the bed with it
Well of course! It's peanut butter, and I didn't/don't really have any problems eating green food.
green mario is best mario
-1:1 you'd have to pay me to put green olives on a pizza
There should be 4 forms for the 4 seasons:  **Winter:** dead branches, snow maybe? **Spring:** brighter green, flowers, maybe a bird nest? **Summer:** current form, or maybe add fruits? **Fall:** colorful leaves, leaf-dropping effect? (similar to flames coming off phoenix) Obviously there are no in-game season, but it could be a choice in an interface or maybe even a time-progression of a few hours?
But first ask yourself; do you need to be somewhere else? The grass is not always greener
That's true in terms of carbon sequestration, but when these trees reach about 50 years of age they will be logged again. The biomass of these trees is not available to decomposers. As they are evergreen, there is hardly any leaf decomposition either. This disrupts the entire food web.
green olives can get out
"Climate change" has been the accurate term since 1952. Global warming was a term that was taken out of context and applied to the wrong concept until it became common. Global warming refers to a global temperature increase caused by greenhouse gasses. Climate change includes many other climate variables; it accounts for all of the responses and feedbacks from increasing C02 concentration in the atmosphere. Basically climate is not just temperature over time. Global warming is a part of climate change.
green jello sucks
im colorblind, are you telling me tennisballs are green right now
I thought apple juice was green until last year. I also thought that the paper dollar bills are printed on were green, not the ink. I'm colorblind, and I seem to have revelations like these every year or so.
I'm 19 and colorblind and last week I learned the reason they sometimes call dollar bills greenbacks. . .    IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE GREEN! Edit: $USD
FUCK these things are basically the lorax, green and fuzzy LORAX FRUITS
I'm doing well for myself. Not counting currently pending ones, I've had 14 portals fully reviewed since submissions came to Prime, and 13 have been accepted. The declined one has been resubmitted with a photosphere... (it's a bowling green, the reviewers claimed they "couldn't find it" which is a load of bullshit but whatever).
Oh, that's an easy one. I finally got the greenlight to get a pet Ball Python, and I knew that they are nocturnal and if the snake were to mess his enclosure while I am asleep, I will be able to help him much faster since I would wake up earlier. I used that as motivation, and now I am awake and out of bed no later than 6:30AM sharp every morning. Not only that, I became a MUCH better sleeper, I would always feel so refreshed every morning, I am happier as an individual... night owls just wouldn't understand.

There may be different types of traffic light where it does nothing, but for the type I know about, it's not bullshit. &amp;#x200B; One type of traffic light controls a pedestrian crossing. It stays green for traffic until a pedestrian pushes the button. &amp;#x200B; The other kind of traffic light is what you find at a junction, and the lights have a clever system that measures the amount of traffic passing through (magnets or pressure sensors placed just under the surface of the road to detect vehicles driving over them), and adjusts the timers to keep the traffic moving evenly. Pedestrians, however, don't show up on the magnets, so that's where the buttons come in. When there are no pedestrians around, the system cycles between giving green lights to each lane of traffic only. Pressing the pedestrian button sends a signal to the traffic lights to include a pedestrian green light during the next cycle. Pressing it more than once won't make it happen any sooner though.
I really - honestly - don't see the same existential threat to the country that you do. Could you help me to understand your position? The DACA recipients: they are ineligible for most forms of social welfare, including food stamps and medicaid. But they pay into those services through their taxes. By pure, heartless economic measures alone, they're a net benefit to the economy. Culturally, they're people who have grown up in America, and who may not remember any other culture, so there's no argument about them not assimilating, or not speaking English. Back to the economic point, whatever money the government was going to spend on them (through education, military training, or both) has been spent. The damage has been done, so to speak. Why deport them *now*, when they're entering the workforce and can pay back into the system through taxes? Back to culture again, one of the requirements for DACA is that they have graduated high school, and/or served in the armed forces, and have no criminal record. These are good people, not "bad hombres", and have contributed more to their community and country than many native citizens. The *only* reason I can see remaining for wanting to deport them [1] is the insistence, just as a matter of pure legalistic principle, that they didn't arrive here the correct way, and therefore they should go. Here's where *my* pragmatic argument steps in. What is gained by deporting these 800,000 people? Line them up, alongside legal immigrants, and native-born children of illegal immigrants, and children of legal immigrants, and green-card holders, and naturalised citizens, and you wouldn't be able to pick them out. How many families, businesses, communities would be torn apart by this action? Would that be worth it? Would this second wrong make a right?  [1] Well, not quite the *only* one. I can think of one more reason why someone would want to deport all these people, but the rule of civility prevents me from bringing it up.
Besides keeping an eye on the plant and watering regularly there is not much to it. I did not use training techniques, special feeding, lights etc. Just kept her in a greenhouse to keep her dry and a little warmer than outside. You could argue that watching plants is work, but for me it is hobby 😁 Harvesting will be some work though, but that’s with all strains I guess.
Ah I see. She is outdoors, but inside a greenhouse. I am in the Netherlands. If the issue is not long enough days how comes that my other 2 plants look just fine? All seeds sprouted in the same days.
That's why she's getting with Bard. It's greencardening.
50shades would beg to differ. I'm pretty sure a lot of the team left on PS2 are right out of college as well, so something tells me they don't have a lot of "real world" experience as well. PS2 is such a sizable, and monstrous project to throw greenhorns at it. I'm sure they're talented and are capable in the long run but a game of this magnitude will be one hell of a learning experience.
My main gripe is the Striker. Go into TR territory, and be ready for 50 strikers coming your way. Oh, you're behind something that blocks the line-of-sight? Fuck you, I'm a striker missile I go where I want. I'm still baffled how Higby decided to green-light the striker since it's a much upgraded annihilator. And we all remember how everyone bitched about that, and it got nerfed faster than the current Striker. I'd be willing to take just being able to break the lock by losing sight, but currently it just goes around obstacles to get to it's target. Total bullshit.
TR mines should get a buff in damage since it's only going in a cone, replace the green lasers coming off it and put two little lumi-fiber line columns going down the the front of the claymore to mimic the lighting of the other two factions. It ain't dat hard SOE!
There's probably a bug, because I've seen the green lasers at least once.
Hi. Does anyone know what [these bumpy ridges](https://imgur.com/a/A4IX0vw) are? Acne? Dry skin? I'm new to skincare products and these ridges became prominent when I used [sulfur](https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/de-la-cruz-sulfur-ointment-10-acne-medication-ointment/ID=prod2872361-product) and [benzoyl peroxide](https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/walgreens-acne-treatment-gel/ID=prod6365194-product) products (Didn't use the products at the same time. The two products were used over a year apart and each was only used for about 3 days when the ridges became more visible.)
Ah, you aren't in a playlist then - you're just playing it as a Challenge. From the Scenario browser, click on the Playlists tab near the top left, then you can either start a playlist by clicking the green play arrow at the left of the name, or you can click the playlist name then in the Playlist window that appears at the bottom right you can click the play button.

As another solo-man indie dev, I have to concur entirely. Just a few weeks ago I bought the $100 greenlight admission ticket and have been gearing up for a debut in the short term. I think this has lit a fire under my ass, although I was already in pretty high gear before hearing this news...
Are those units of "green peace Chernobyl" where tens of thousands (if not millions) died, or "real life Chernobyl"? Because in real life less than 100 died, and it was almost entirely the responders to the incident. Green peace likes to point to a spike in thyroid cancer but the reality is that the incidence of thyroid cancer post Chernobyl falls in line with the rest of the world, and no one was looking for thyroid cancer in people from that area prior to Chernobyl.

Not sure how lucky I got on this, but: T3 SW, CK, rest GE. Somehow, the CK ate the first cannon blasts (and died) as my SW damn near one-shot the Golem, then the green eagles distracted the gunners long enough for the SW to eat them.
When you are holding forward and a strafe in air, try to keep the green section right at your crosshair. That provides the most amount of acceleration.
For the electronic balloting, you seem to agree with me. I'm just saying that the greens say that we should only go with paper ballots, ignoring the fact that electronic ballots can be done right.  I disagree. Are you aware of how little nuclear waste there actually is? If you got your entire lifetime span of energy (including heating, transportation, and electricity) from nuclear power, the amount of waste you would generate would be small enough to fit inside of a soda can. Nuclear power is more energy dense than fossil fuels by a factor of 2 million. It may seem ridiculous, but I'm not making that number up. We do have solutions for long-term storage, but the problem is that since we aren't using our fuel in fast-spectrum reactors, the waste will take tens of thousands of years before it is below background radiation levels. If we used our fuel in fast-spectrum reactors, they would be below those levels in less than 300 years. It's much more reasonable to engineer a solution for 300 years than it is for tens of thousands of years, so you run into lots of complications like we have been seeing at Yucca mountain. Even so, we do in fact have solutions that will hold for those tens of thousands of years, including the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. If we just took our already expended waste and mixed it in with new fuel for a fast-spectrum reactor, we could eliminate the 'waste problem' in a fairly short amount of time. If you have any questions about this, feel free to ask. I'm a Computer Engineer by degree, but a Nuclear Engineer by job title. (I maintain computer systems at a nuclear power plant)
I disagree - reality does not contradict what I'm stating. What pollution incidents are you talking about? The radiation levels of the exclusion zone around Fukushima are all just as high as New York City is until you get inside the fence. The only reason they are keeping it closed off is paranoia and poor education. Chernobyl is definitely an issue, but you'd have to have ridiculous levels of intentional destruction to get something like that to happen again (if you want me to expand upon this issue, I can, but most people seem to understand the ridiculous levels of malfeasance the soviets managed). As for the waste in the long term, refer back to my previous post on the energy density of nuclear fission. The reason no long term solution has been realized is because it has not yet been necessary. We have been storing all of our spent fuel on-site because it's compact enough that we can do that. That factor of *2 million* times the energy density means a lot - reprocessing simply isn't worth it financially when the fuel is so comparatively cheap in the first place. Once we have enough spent fuel that it becomes a problem, there are options. We can use something along the lines of Yucca mountain, but realistically we will probably end up burning the waste away in fast spectrum reactors so that the waste will be at background level radiation in less than 300 years. The real world of nuclear power is robust design with many fail-safes and completely separate backups. When you read scare articles describing how a component failed in a nuclear power plant (implying that it would be a local Chernobyl with little more provocation), what they are omitting to tell you is that there were still dozens of barriers and devices preventing these incidents from causing issues where any single device successfully functioning ends the event. Furthermore, nuclear incidents happen slowly. This is a great advantage as far as safety goes, but it definitely gives the media time to speculate and assume the worst in every possible way. A nuclear accident isn't like Bhopal where suddenly tens of thousands are dead. There is a stark difference between the coal industry and the nuclear industry. The numbers don't lie - nuclear has an impeccable safety record. What would it take to convince you that there are no serious nuclear industry deceptions that are a cause for concern (speaking for the USA, anyway - I don't honestly know enough about the rest of the world's industries to defend them)? Would showing you that anti-nuclear propaganda and "green" groups are funded by the fossil fuel industry help? After all, the only real competitor financially to nuclear power is the fossil fuel industry. They have the most to gain by smearing the nuclear industry.
Yep! They have a bunch of green designs on the front that disappear when baby is wet. :)
I honestly wish it wasn’t known as “birth control”. There’s such a stigma around it, and women who desperately need it don’t get it for religious reasons, fear of judgment, or even parents who are determined to believe that it’s merely a green light for sex. Why couldn’t they call it “hormone control” or “hormone therapy” or something. It does SO much more than prevent pregnancy. I hate to see women writhing in pain every month because they refuse it or are refused it. :(
Are you the green ninja?
to me, green
ITT: DAE le hate green? lololol im so cool :3 /r/tf2: full of accused grass haters, more at 9
i just began like a week ago and i really like 100% polyester, my only complaint with it is that if i move my fingers too fast i end up burning myself, but other than that it's neato edit: i got it from yotricks.com, neon green because that's really flashy
Elko does splendiferous activities almost every hour, come watch and drown him in green paper, maybe you can come scream at your keyboard as you punch it with your tiny arms on your one big arm. Don't forget to throw your ass in a circle either
\&gt;...And for 4chan-like greentext. like this (for example)
what effect? edit: nevermind, had to zoom. green confetterini
i've noticed that ever since i've gotten my green energy demoman's fro that i've done really good as demo, as i'm usually shit at it
Keto would get rid of the taco bowl and throw all the greens back on.
The Neon would just fall apart when the light turned green, though.
What I've been doing is killing it with veggies. I have a locker at school that's stocked with canned green beans, carrots, ramen, and some soup. If I have the time/willing to spend the cash, I'll go to the grocery store for lean cuisine and steamable broccoli. Garlic/salt/pepper/hot sauce for seasoning when needed. Canned veggies are &lt;$1/can here if you get just the generics, and then ramen is anywhere from $0.19/pack to $0.27/pack depending on where I shop. Food stamps is a nice thing if you can get it. My Federal Workstudy job waives the hours/week requirement, so I get the full $200 for working 15 hours a week. [As for meal points.](https://i.imgflip.com/sc2ud.jpg)
Being a pedestrian trying to cross the road from Acadiana Lanes to Checkers is so much fun. The lane turning left from Sam's Club has their turn, then that light turns to green go-if-you-can, and the pedestrian signal turns green at that time. I've been almost hit over ten times now, and the drivers yell/honk their asses off like I'm in the wrong.
What, no green super saiyan helmet?
I *think* you should be able to, but I really can't give you a concrete answer. The only thing I can find regarding the game running on integrated graphics of any sort is a post from January 2014 regarding the game running about 20fps on Intel HD 4000. Between any optimizations since then as well as how much stronger Iris Pro graphics are, I think you should be in the green for playing the game, but that's all extrapolation on my part.
More like "mildly informed." So, was this bowel movement a smooth one? Baby green or darker? Was it bouyant?
I love LSU's giant campus. Plenty of trails to walk along the lakes, squirrels everywhere. It's a shock to go to the other parts of Baton Rouge and realize you live where the grass is literally greener.
Sometimes, food being green means it's *good* to eat.
Looking it up, that would only matter for surround sound systems with a front channel. Pretty sure OP was talking about internal laptop speakers. Not to mention my personal speakers have this fabled green tip, and they work perfectly fine.
With 3KIAT confirmed in the Icewind Dale book, they should definitely be the next evergreen.
It's funny because the aliens are the way they are because K.A. Applegate purposely made them as hard to duplicate for TV or a movie as possible after scholastic didn't like her original aliens which were basically little green men.
Slot 9 would be problematic for other reasons too, because it already has 2 evergreen champions.
Those are fair points. I do have all my evergreens fully epic, and I suppose I don't honestly use them all that often. Might save up for the Strong Core then...
New "Blood War'' skins for Minsc, Delina, Nerys, Shandie and Krydle, each with a unique feat. $9.99 each, or the complete pack for $39.99. Each comes with feat, 7 chests (champion chests for event champions or supply chests for evergreens) and Minsc and Delina each come with a Potion of Polish.
Unironically, is...is that gem green? I know I'm colorblind but I didn't think I was *that* colorblind. On a related note, it took me forever to figure out who's actually talking in each panel because of that.
(Toa Tahu Nuva, from Lego's Bionicle toy line) would probably be most accurate. Edit: Also, reading fully your description, the 'green thing' is his head, Toa wear masks. It'd be easier to see that if the quality was better, but I screencapped this from a 240p youtube video, so it's not very good.
I managed one in leafgreen. My only game I've ever 100% the pokedex in. I really want to replay it, but I don't want to lose all those pokemon. It's be okay if I could transfer them up, but at a limit of 6 per day to Platinum, it doesn't seem worth the effort.
I think the green Ibanez pedal in the second picture is some sort of Keeley mod if anyone cares.
Ew green cake?!
"green" is an unincorporated area located in "Yolo" county California. [I'm not making this up](https://www.google.com/search?q=California+Green&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8)

richmonds preetyyy good for green
...peanut butter isn't green?
If you're specifically looking for a light that may help with migraines, you should stick with dimmable soft green light bulbs, which have shown [some promise for migraines](https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/139/7/1971/2464334). They will run you $1-2 a bulb and can be found at lowes/home depot/amazon/etc. If the bulb in your salt lamp is changeable, I would look into finding a low heat green bulb to replace it with, you should see more benefit.
I'm going to go out on a limb here and call bullshit. You may not know it, but you use corn products [all the fucking time.](https://www.cheatsheet.com/life/18-surprising-everyday-items-made-with-corn.html/) If you really aren't a corn person, how about leafy greens like lettuce or kale? This is actually a commonly known problem and at best it offers no better pathogen protection than conventional, with most cases the [organics being worse](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5156503), though more research needs to be done across the board.
Woah now, I don't remember Oliver or Noah claiming things like [the New Zealand mosque shooter was a left wing radical green new dealer](https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2019/03/15/new-zealand-shooting-typically-politicized-by-the-left/). Or that 10% of any group, much less one with over a billion people in, [are terrorists](https://www.mediamatters.org/glenn-beck/beck-thinks-10-percent-muslims-are-terrorists). Or that maybe Notre Dame was burned down by [Islamists and that we'll never find out about it](https://mobile.twitter.com/JasonSCampbell/status/1117960297388572673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fd-42715609340846088.ampproject.net%2F1908162134430%2Fframe.html). They are not quite that caliber of nutjob, not yet at least.
Agreed, Clark county is basically a greener version of Idaho.
As a veteran, that kind of stuff really does improve moral and soldiers lives, taking away funds from any of those things is another few inches form the big green weenie, very not cool. There are often not many things a young junior enlisted soldier has to do or look forward to, I know MWR campgrounds, equipment rentals, grounds/parks, and resorts as well as getting some college done were on a very short list for me. If I was active duty I'd be really pissed right now.
That's, not exactly true. Nicotine is a fairly potent neurotoxin used as a pesticide, its presence can be detrimental to all kinds of bugs/insects including bees. Heavy metals are pretty rare and most juul pods don't contain a significant amount, and plastic is only bad in certain forms, but is largely inert. Plastic is, after all, a polymerized version of the natural thing we found in the ground in the first place, and while it and the processing of it causes increased greenhouse gases, it does break down and is far less environmentally unfriendly (except certain shapes, rings can choke animals, sharp edges can stab them, but as a whole, they aren't bad).
Good! And yeah wind sucks sometimes, I remember my buddy loading a bowl on a ski lift (you should always load before the lift, that was his first mistake), for some reason he thought opening up the bottom grinder to add kief was a good idea, watched as a snowy green dust blew into the wind the second he got it open. I couldn't stop laughing but he was nearly in tears, luckily we live in a legal state so bud is very cheap and easy to come by.
Like I said, there was a temporary ban a few years ago, that article is from 2016, 3 years ago. And plenty of local vendors sell those names and there derivatives now. The first place I looked at near me is [Green mart](https://www.leafly.com/dispensary-info/green-mart) (not affiliated and they don't carry my favorite brands) and they have several varieties of cookies named as such, as well as Gobstopper, several types of cake, all kinds of strains that were initially banned by that temporary ban, but seem to no longer apply.
It highly depends on where you are, if you live in a liberal city, especially one that considers themselves a "green" city, you will find plenty. In more rural communities you'll be more reliant on neighbors than public spaces.
It is punishment after the fact, but so is pretty much every crime. Banning cocaine doesn't stop people from using it, it punishes them for getting caught.  Well, we actually already do this all the time. This is actually a large part of what epidemiologists do (as well as bigger picture prevention and control), we have timetables of how diseases progress, how long it takes from exposure to actual illness (incubation period), and how it normally spreads (air, surface, food, etc.). Using this data as well as public health reports/records to back track and trace sources of infection. We have gotten surprisingly good at doing this which is a large part of why extremely deadly diseases don't spread further than they do (when people listen). Often times they will get histories from patients to try and find commonalities as well. For instance, let's say a stomach bug has an incubation period of 2-3 days is normally associated with leafy greens, and suddenly you get 8 cases to one hospital in a 2 day period, taking their history you would ask what salads and other things they've had or places with that they've visited a couple days prior. When 7 out of 8 say they went to the same buffet 2 days ago, the health department will go and test that buffet and the greens there to confirm, now we have the source of the infection, this information can then be used to reach people who ate there by public broadcast/service message.
As a biochem major with 4.0, and also someone with ADHD, you are the one in the wrong, friend. Strains do make a huge difference, When you live in a legal state and can have each back to back, you notice a huge difference. And the difference doesn't come from different cannabinoids, it (mostly) comes from differences in terpenes which appear to modulate the receptors. Try some green crack in the morning one day and GDP that night, then flip that the next day, report back to me with your results.
This. Although I would splurge and get the $15 a gram ones, the taste is much better and the effects seem slightly more consistent. Evergreen recently dropped in price and has really good RSO. Don't go for the $10 a gram, it works, but tastes like ass.
Totally honest, I have protanopia. And wait, kiwis ARE green? My whole life is a lie.
Wait, hold the fuck up. Is peanut butter not green?
You clearly don't know many plastic surgeons (there are different types of plastic surgeons though). Money is green no matter where it comes from. Regardless of how idiotic the patients wishes. Just Google "man turns himself into..." and click any of the auto-completions to see what I mean. Cat, dog, elf, for fucks sake people. But again, not my body, not my money, not my problem.
Caffeine helps, try some green tea or something. Also b-vitamins just help you feel more "awake". Like someone else mentioned, 5-htp may help, I've seen mixed evidence on it and don't use it personally (with this drug at least) but it's worth a shot. I feel much better if I take a couple Excedrin. For exercise, try yoga if you don't already. Do it the first 30 minutes after you wake up in the morning. Lastly make sure you are hydrated well, and that doesn't mean just drink a lot of water. You're body needs some salts to help take in and retain the water. I've found that Powerade zero has more salts than Gatorade, plus it has b-vitamins. I recommend drinking one before bed and one in the morning. This helps for alcohol and any other diuretic drug as well.
Sea of green?
There's a massive multi-screen in the MOTD green room. You can sometimes see it when they go on Facebook Live. [Telegraph do a nice little run-down of the show](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/sportvideo/footballvideo/11049907/Watch-behind-the-scenes-on-Match-of-the-Day.html)
I love how he made the Seminole green to watch our gator. It's the Hulk!
Is that the greenwood kit?
Oh, and mine has a greenwood kit.
Pretty sure its a green light
I used one once, I had never heard that it was a bad idea, less than an hoir later I got really pale and almost green and I threw up a lot. I havent used one since.
Well it was the first nofx album I got?I bought wolwes when it came out, really thought it sucked back then. In fact, it turned out to be really good. I don't think they ever released a bad album. Still Number 1, I'm surprised and excludint bands like green day it was the first punk album I ever got and it started my love for the genre and was the begining of a period of my life where I was finding so many new bands and listening to things I had never known about before. So it may only be number one out of a sentimental place but even without that Im sure it would have made my top 5.
I live in a green field with a cow looking at a camera, she's strange tho.
Yeah, its more like a stay at a green field, just put a headphone and listen to it with your eyes closed album.
Both of them has amazing voices, but i personally prefer Gilmour's voice. Roger, specially in The Wall, he's voice makes you feel the album vibe, there are times he sings loud and he pass this feeling for you. But Gilmour's voice is soothing and comfy, if you listen to On An Island you'll realize that. In Fan Old Sun he's voice is so calm, i really feel like i'm in a green field below that fat old sun. Gilmour and Roger's voice is like sun and moon. One is calm and beautiful while the other is powerful and grabs your attention. What you guys think?
Mine has a green vertical line on the left, hate this
No matter how many texture, ENB and Static Mesh mods you install - those trellises that surround the Gildergreen always look like shit.
It's sad that this is true. The article says they want to preserve it to maintain the area's "green" aesthetic but time after time they've just built glass and steel monoliths. We get it - the steel represents Sheffield's longstanding industrial heritage. Now come up with some other ideas!
It's a reference to a 4chan greentext story.
Quite a bit of Greenland is green, and quite a bit of Iceland is ice. Especially the parts that the founder's arrived in and at certain times of the year. Besides - According to some Sagas, Greenland was named so because the founder realised the place was pretty bad and named it a lush-sounding name and sent people back to Iceland to advertise it so people would travel over. It was *meant* to sound better than the place actually is...
I was raised by the sea and I can't stand the smell of fish, but 10 years ago I emigrated to rural England and I can't get enough of the smell of Muckspreading! Reminds me of summers and the green countryside.
Fuck, I remember Dongcopter Pirate from when he was stickied at the top of /b/. His real name is Aleksandr Pistoletov and he does even worse videos than this but this is the only one that was allowed on YouTube. The other ones consist of him standing in from of porn on a green screen and interacting with the video behind him, so if there was a video of a woman masturbating he'd pretend to be having sex with her on the green screen. [This](http://aleksandrpistoletov.ru/) is his website [slightly NSFW] [This](http://aleksandrpistoletov.ru/videoklipy-2/aleksandr-pistoletov---k-beregam-bez-tsenzury) is an example of his other videos [Definitely NSFW]
Well, to get to NIS you click a big green button that says 'Play Beta'. That's a clue by the way.

Not only that, but Dihydrogen Monoxide: * is called "hydroxyl acid", the substance is the major component of acid rain. * contributes to the "greenhouse effect". * may cause severe burns. * is fatal if inhaled. * contributes to the erosion of our natural landscape. * accelerates corrosion and rusting of many metals. * may cause electrical failures and decreased effectiveness of automobile brakes. * has been found in excised tumors of terminal cancer patients. Despite the danger, dihydrogen monoxide is often used: * as an industrial solvent and coolant. * in nuclear power plants. * in the production of Styrofoam. * as a fire retardant. * in many forms of cruel animal research. * in the distribution of pesticides. Even after wash* ing, produce remains contaminated by this chemical. * as an additive in certain "junk-foods" and other food products.
Yeah it was, I remember the Truth and Reconciliation mission where it was really dark and you had to use the green outline to see. /offtopic
Go green!
Ahhh I'm a student as well. Go green!
Go green!
I'm lvl 39 and play the same way! If I'm out of things to do while waiting on crafting, I also browse the market for good deals around 25k-100k in value (make sure you have enough max energy to surcharge it!) then add enhancements and spirits to it to raise the price while keeping the energy cost to surcharge the same. Any expensive item you can manage should be enchanted and have a spirit, especially green quality or higher.
Kraft Dinner (as us Canadians call Mac and Cheese) is much better with fresh cracked pepper and green onion on top, but adding salt would not be appetising... The cheese is a sharp enough flavour already! Adding crumbly hot italian sausage is the bomb, too.
Well yeah, every time the crown becomes aware that its wearer isn't Evergreen, it warps the wearer's mind into ridding itself of it or denying the connection.
You can be very happy being single and still get lonely, there's nothing wrong with that either! The grass is always greener on the other side and all that.
I like the hedge, but think about adding greenery everywhere! Maybe you could have a patio made of birch off to the side or a garage on the other side. The driveway should probably connect to the house somehow though, I feel. You've got a good base, but it certainly could use some dressing up. When all your structures are down, go nuts with bonemeal on the grass everywhere!
Surely you can picture the dude from green mile or jack nicholson saying some of the things that people around us have typed. If it helps having the visual, go for it. I have done voicework in the past so I'm not sure if my personality (always willing to imitate) suits this pattern of thoughts better, but surely you can change your internal monologue to a different voice. This is part of the reason that our voice sounds weird when we hear it recorded and played back to us. We picture ourselves sounding differently than we do. *Surely* you can hear some celebrity/public figure's voice if not the archetypal little girl or old man or whatever.
I have it tagged as "Best Bot" in lime green.
This, exactly. It's better to look like you're not paying attention while stopped at a green light (probably texting or something) than it is to take a life-threatening risk.
green eyes, "high" iq and i'm a descendant of germans in Argentina
Beautiful green
yo dawg hit me up i need sum a that munny fo sum green i got an album to spit on fresh shit ya hear? gonna make me rich jus need sum munny fo that inspiration weed real quick lol
[This is a good site](http://darksitefinder.com/maps/world.html#8/37.231/-120.853) for finding a good dark zone. You want to shoot for a spot which is at least green, but darker is better. Pacheco Pass near San Luis reservoir is pretty good, if it's not cloudy. Takes me ~30 minutes to drive out to that area when there's no traffic. If you get on 5 and head a bit further south you'll be able to find some darker roads right off the freeway.
some fast food places have sugar packets and lemon slices so you can make lemonade with your free water dive for food behind grocery stores. krispy kreme donuts throws out their extra donuts at the end of the day and little caesars throws out their hot-n-ready pizzas. learn which plants are edible. in my area i can pick boysenberries and grapes along the railroad tracks. thistles and dandelion greens are edible.
i dunno could use some more john green quotes ..
Conventions are where lonely people go to settle for each other. This greentext is fake as fuck, though.
Same here. If I hadn't known it was a wide lens I would have just assumed it was green screened or something.
I agree it's unrealistic. I guess I should have clarified that the exercise part of it was to represent the average American. The diet is more an extreme caricature of the average American and is comparable to all the 4chan greentext stories about amerifats visiting other countries and constantly eating, shooting guns, tipping, and clapping. It's taking things to an extreme for impact, though it's usefulness is questionable (like those lab tests that find out that if you eat a third of your weight in some chemical sweetener that you'll get cancer).
I find it pretty sexy that they sorted the results from shortest to longest when reporting them in greentext.
[Mondo grass](http://daylilynursery.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/green-mondo-grass.jpg) is very hearty and attractive. The [dwarf](http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/736x/8a/4a/e4/8a4ae40e9488e0c032871f8f996662d2.jpg) variety could be used for fashionable trims as well.
Yeah, it honestly wasn't very good. The overall story and writing was kind of shit and it relied too much on being over the top and random to get laughs. Everything felt disjointed and thrown together to try to form some overarching story that gave an excuse for all the 'totally '80s' stuff that people mistakenly seem to think happened in '80s movies all the time. It's also completely obvious how much of it was done in front of a green screen, which is not at all in the spirit of inventive and practical effects, which were a big part of the '80s (at least to me they were).
I'm the one who cooks all the holiday meals for my family. I love to cook, so I don't mind, so long as people stay the fuck out of the kitchen while I'm cooking. [Brined turkey cooked breast down, dressing, mashed potatoes, biscuits, gravy, roasted squash, sweet potato and green apple bake, and a shitload of pies.](http://i.imgur.com/rYzGDwA.jpg) Unfortunately, I ran out of vodka last night and was cooking all morning, so I didn't have time to pick up more. I have been entirely sober this entire holiday and it sucks.
Man, he sucks at greentext.
A lot of dollar stores are transitioning over to that [Stars &amp; Stripes](http://www.dollartree.com/catalog/product.jsp?productId=321811&amp;green=A93A0142-3463-5375-B124-31F23367D8A9) shit. I thought Shasta actually tasted good, but this stuff is pretty meh.
Fucking *Happy Feet* really pissed me off with its heavy handed green message. I understand that global warming and all that shit is a big problem and I do my best to not fuck up the earth, but if I'm going to see a movie about a fugly little penguin who loves to dance and uses it to overcome adversity in his life I *don't want to be accosted with a serious subject matter*. Just like if I'm walking out of Whole Foods with a bag of veggie sticks *I fucking don't want to talk to Greenpeace just outside the door. I just want to eat veggie sticks, damnit!* That is one movie I genuinely hate. It ripped off at least one joke that I can remember from one of my favourite childhood movies, *Scamper the Penguin*, and just had an overall *fucking awful* plot because it entwined its green message into it. And the fucking writing! Here's some of the dialogue, almost verbatim:    That was the moment that cemented my hate for the movie. All these penguins are dancing for some reason? The logical conclusion is that they're burning off all those extra calories by dancing *because they don't have enough food*. What kind of dumbass wrote that and thought it made any sense? TL;DR: Probably not a metaphor, but fuck *Happy Feet*.
\&gt;still greentexting in 2014
I used to put in Super Mario 64, go to a level where I knew there was a green mushroom at the top of a pole, climb the thing, then run away from the green mushroom for as long as I could (since they follow you). Another one my brother and I used to do a lot is Halo co-op with only grenades and melee.
The DVD is cheap enough. I see copies of it at BigLots and walgreens all the time for $3.
I'm calling bullshit on this whole story due to there being no mention of refreshments (green Jello specifically) at the end.
One of my friends had a roommate who found out that I liked old game consoles and gave me the Fairchild Channel F he got when he was a kid to hold on to along with ten or so games. I'm not sure if he ever intends to take it back. Needs some repairs though, unfortunately. All I get is a green screen when I try to play anything.
Nah, you're safe. I don't think I've ever seen anything green served at Popeyes.
Chapter doctrine. They have one of the strongest chapter tactics. Hopefully the other green marines get a good revamp with the next PA book.
Yes. Sorry it's supposed to be a new plastic kit. The rumor specifically pointed out the green plastic rod is gone, replaced by one in the same vein as the immortals. No idea what happens to the scarabs
I feel like there should be a control crystal in that hand &amp; a green tinted explosion in the background.
Or in the wast future when Mars would be already green and Earth would be just emptry rock nobody remembers about.
I live right by a walgreens. I'd go buy all of the pre paid gift cards and steam card
I used a gtx 650 with mint 18-19.3 and pop Os 20.04 with no problems. Now I have a gtx 970 on pop 20.04. No problems with Nvidia proprietary drivers. I game and do media creation. I can overclock and control GPU fan with GWE (green with envy) and editing one life of code on one config file. Both cards worked plug and play with both mint and pop.
Any others from /colorblind thinks the lighting or editing on this jersey makes this look slightly mint green?
Was that a green cards hat next to Murray or am I that colorblind?
I want green.
I think a raiders stadium there would actually work. It will be the green bay of California.
I'll bust out green man if you give me nachos and Rams tickets.... and plane tickets to St. Louis.
Walgreens delivers :D
you guys are getting green coins?
Luigi wears green
I closed the game once after a green pipe and I still got the item it just didn't tell me which one it was. It was one of the normal drivers I think
I love playing around with characters, so green pill. No matter the character, at least I would be the best at it.
you can go to hazards off Shadow Moses island and throw a green shell at the wall
Rocky De La Fuente III has the most votes out of those in the race still https://www.thegreenpapers.com/P20/D Also Rocky De La Fuente is still running for the Republican primary, what about him?
I got it with a mega mushroom and coin frenzy after some grinding. Tier 3 Lv 1 driver, T3 Lv 1 kart, T2 Lv 2 glider. I actually got a triple frenzy on it before (bob-omb, green shell, banana) but that didn't even give me five stars lol.
read the last line of greentexts first
There’s a pretty cute movie based off the original Super Mario Bros.! The designs a pretty different from modern Mario (Luigi isn’t even green!) but that kind of adds to the charm to it. There’s also a few educational and fairy tail Mario anime, plus an interactive Super Mario World video you use with a toy telephone. https://www.mariowiki.com/Category:Anime
I hade one neon green now I could have both
this is like Bowser with Ludwig’s face and hair also he has green arms here, just like in Super Mario World where it is was an oversight
This greentext is closer in time to Half Life 2 Episode 2 than today
That is cool! I imagined the zombie to have green skin and the doll to be more baby-like.
green Greninja though
wait Luigi has two neon green Joycon
I don’t see any green text
ads should definitely be greentexts themselves but not in-your-face since I hate ads like that. !RemindMe 36 hours
/r/greentext
This isn't /r/greentext
yeah in Deluxe but also I haven't been hit by green shells that much in any game
I don't think they changed green shells, they just hit you if you were unlucky enough to be caught in the ricochet or someone had really good aim.
just like the greentext story of the Heavy player that loved his Medic but had to stop playing
oh wow it does look like it blonde hair, devil headband, green dress
the green one
/r/greentext
Small world, my brother is going as a lime green Scout too.
Wow. I made this by googling the "green eggs and ham full text" and then putting it through a word replacement program. For example, Sam-&gt;Valve, green eggs and ham-&gt;competitive matchmaking, and eat-&gt;play. The text had a few typos. This is probably one of them. Long story short, I did not write all of this, I just edited it.
Oh yeah, this was the very old and odd anime. So old that Luigi wasn't established as green yet.
"Boss, I was late to work since for some reason this a**hole have parked at a green light for five minutes."
*-65 (in green text)*
I say it's fake because some things in the trailer simply wouldn't be possible in-game, like being 2D inside the stage, and being on a 3D hill. It's also very mellow and lacking the hype and action that every other trailer has. It's very convincing graphically, though. It was just too obviously green-screened. Did anyone misread this as "Rovio", the developer of Angry Birds? They're coming out with a movie soon, too. EDIT: Ravio was literally inside the stage, guys. Nothing goes into the actual stage yet in Smash Bros.
I found an empty green olive oil bottle in the recycling and started waving it around. I broke it. I bled. It was so worth it.
colorless green ideas sleep furiously
I agree. The packer fans that come in here and talk are pretty nice but outside of that, I haven't been impressed. I lurked their sub before and after we played them and afterwards they kept saying how they "destroyed us" when they won by 5 points. Living in packers nation, I can tell you that 95% of them are like this and don't know any football besides "I want the team in green to win."
Why does she look green-screenish?
I think this just describes WH40K fandom - stories of gothic space marines fighting ridiculous greenskin orks presented as serious narration and everyone loves the Emperor or Chaos more than life itself.
Maybe their mental image of a vulva involves Nickelodeon green slime.
Where's that green text post?
Yeah, I attempted to figure it out via a PM, but just got a generic reply about violating the sidebar rules but no specific post or comment was mentioned or which rule I broke. I've decided to just move on to (hopefully) greener pastures.
Colorblind here. Recently learned that mint chocolate chip ice cream is often green. Blew my mind.
Also colorblind. Didn't know mint chocolate chip ice cream is usually green.
Vancouver is trapped between water and mountains. Everything is built out to Chilliwack. The few patches of green you see are arable farmland.  One of the main issues is density. There's a lot of SFH in Van. For example, it was only fairly recently that the Cambie corridor finally has mid/high density residential. It was SFH for the longest time.
That's green alright. I would have also [accepted this](https://youtu.be/pR5q0ajW8Ko?t=112).
In all fairness, moving to the US isn't easy. Dat green card lottery.
Don't bother with a PhD in engineering unless you are going the academia route. Save yourself some money.  Maybe you could better describe what you want out of your career by fleshing out sustainability for me, since it's a fairly new field. Are you referring to development/LEED building design stuff; retrofit for existing structures; environmental remediation; policy/politics; standards council; urban planning; transportation; agriculture and food systems; water resources; green tech?
The new thermal view, you can't walk around at all, that truck and the buildings aren't visible at all.  The greenscale? Everything is green, so there's nothing that stands out as a mech. I just see green. Honestly, I can't tell where the jenner stops and begins, and there's no cent in the shot.
Tap for green mana
Imagine one of the detained green card holders reading this post. Your lack of empathy is sickening. Narrowminded selfishness vs compassion for humanity as a whole? "lolz none of the protesters have jobz anyways lolz". My aunt and uncle are both professors at the University of Delaware and they partook in the protests. They contribute to society everyday. Tell me, what makes you and your occupation so much better than those who were protesting?
They exist only in a dimension that the player can see, for easy recognition of where sam is positioned in the dark. Alternate choice: everyone in the splinter cell universe is totally green colourblind and therefore can't see the lights
Just.. don't feed your dogs gysahl greens..
I hope it's green. Green enchantments are awesome: Abundance, Sylvan Library, Greater Good, Survival of the Fittest...so many sick ones. I have a custom cube, and this card in it is what I would print:
One of my favorite rulings ever is "If something is green, it can't be nongreen"
[Here's](https://youtu.be/yHrV9smkOJI) the video of it in action. Doesn't look as terrifyingly otherworldly here as it does with green lights
I screamed when they didn't do *that* green part
Oh okay. I was dumb to take it to the wrong side. May your friendship and brotherhood be evergreen and long lasting
I don't know the actual name but it was specifically for 'green' businesses.
Don't use anything that does what greenify does. It's a dead concept. Rooting does nothing to your battery life.
Are you from 2014? Don't use greenify.
The money wasn't for schools. It was for green businesses. The private school technically fit that description.
The fund isn't for schools, it's for "green" businesses. The private school being a business and all.
Because they're both green and parrots. That's about it. Kakapo are fatter and don't fly.
I don't understand. Why are you asking if they're evergreen then if you know that evergreen trees don't drop leaves?
Evergreens are called evergreens because they are *always* green because their leaves don't drop off.
They're absolutely crap. People just like having all the lights go green on the controller interface. They aren't even capable of DNS level blocking.
It's not a blanket stance. https://www.greens.org.nz/page/agriculture-and-rural-affairs-policy-0 It actually allows for scientific research.
"Back off green".
You've probably only heard positive comments from the /r/ubiquiti sub. That place is a terrible circlejerk.  These are things that literally any firewall can do.  This is the only reason people buy them. To get all the cool green lights in their webpage.  I'm not really sure what you're asking. The hardware is irrelevant.
You can't pick greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere, mate.
Road user charges aren't a tax on greenhouse gases, they're charges for literally using the road.
Yes, right, that's what I've been trying to communicate this whole time. The green circle though, means as turning traffic they must give way.
After a select few took issue with their presence.  Ok, cool, but that's only *your* opinion. It's actually for protection rather than as a weapon of war but surely you knew that, right? That gun is for self defence, not destroying targets. The fact that it's green and looks scary to you doesn't make them bad people.  Militarisation of what? Being gay?
I have only ever owned Japanese cars and they all had green coolant.
No one said "climate denier". It definitely makes people show animosity towards "greenies" and "hippies".
Bullshit stance. I voted green. Green aren't big enough to compromise the integrity of the NZDF and Labour has provided more funding and support than National ever did. I won't vote Green again because I don't like them now but it's silly to say you won't because you think they'll disband the entire military.
1. Dairy cows emit an enormous amount of greenhouse gasses and contribute to our emissions massively. This is bad. 2. Dairy is not a necessary food for anyone. It does more harm than good. Humans aren't meant to digest dairy, which is why it gives so many people adverse reactions.
The cost is millions of litres of fuel, water and greenhouse gasses though.
There's a lot of green too... MAKE UP YOUR GODDAMN MIND.
Literally the same technology as green screen.
I don't think it's that they're in hard to reach places, I think it's literally just the green fees/membership costs. In rural areas it's cheap.
Well, it's not shitty because the purpose of the greens is to save power. They both have their purpose and advantages.
How to show people you don't understand the greenhouse effect 101.
For anyone wondering why this is downvoted so much, the comment initially read something like "I doubt the greens would like this, there's bound to be a tree that needs cutting down".
http://www.onegreenplanet.org/natural-health/soy-free-vegan-foods-that-have-more-protein-than-beef/ http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2540540 Tempeh, brocolli, spinach and peanut butter too.
It gets released into the ground, not into the atmosphere. Ever wonder why the greenhouse effect was an issue if all the carbon doesn't disappear?
The green party supports research of GMOs. That is **literally** evidence based policy.
But the rate at which they've done so has increased once we started pumping greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. Climate change occurs naturally, the rate at which it happens is directly attributable to humans.
Such a fucking anti-green circlejerk. People are frothing at the mouth to see her punished for this without fucking paying attention to the message.
The gangs use various markers to point out where dogs are to the 'snatch' crews. I assume OP is talking about a little green dot that you would get at school.
It's in their policy. https://home.greens.org.nz/ge
You have to buy food at some point. When you do, you go to the greengrocers as well. Not *wanting to* isn't really a case of not being able to.
How do you not have the option to go to greengrocers rather than the supermarket?
There's no green. Oh.
Sorry, I mean, how are you finding used WD greens in a NAS environment. Do they work well?
There's two things wrong with your examples. 1. Your minimum daily requirements are skewed by dairy and other animal product lobbies in USA. 2. A combination of many leafy greens will provide said nutrients. You don't get all your nutrients from a single source at a time.
The green party's GMO stance is more open than it used to be.
Also wanting to know if there was a straight through green. This is an important distinction.
Actually it's a green hue, if we're getting technical.
Place of green? Heh.
Your references don't actually address the above question. Bitcoin_noob is right, if you have a green pedestrian crossing, no green arrows should be lit to cross that path. Straight ahead greens may be lit, but never an arrow.
The sun is actually slightly green shifted.
Jesus fucking Christ go to A&amp;E. Nothing should be green.
Like the green party...?
Those same people apparently have never eaten leafy greens in their lives.
"upgrade"? Those green lights really are the best marketing ploy ever.
No they haven't. https://home.greens.org.nz/ge
A green plastic tiki necklace and a bungy jumping sheep toy.
You should start an organisation. Something to do with peace. Oh, and being green, because green is good. Maybe, "Peace green"? No, that's not it. Side note: don't join green peace, they're dicks.
No one's said it yet, so I'll say it: "Green" refers to cleanliness and natural. I agree that we are not a very "green" country in that regard, we have terrible pollution, but we're better than some. Don't do drugs.
Nah but a lot of people have said things like "that's some green hay" implying they know at least something.
Why doesn't this guy just cut the fucking tree down before announcing it to whoever these greenies are getting their info from?
Don't use greenify. You're killing your battery by killing processes (unless you go full pro and know exactly why you're using it)
Please get this to the top. Stop using greenify. By killing processes they need to be fully loaded into ram every time you open them. You're probably using more battery than you would be if you didn't have greenify.
Unless there's green beret team 6 delta force snipers on hand, inaccuracy is just something to mitigate, not completely remove. Add to that the stress of the situation, the lack of meaningful experience to draw upon and the few options the officers would have available, it's not an easy situation for us to sit here and say "they should have done this or that"
No, they don't want one after the other. They would rather a crayfish **THAN** green lines.
I think you'll find [they actually can](http://www.greenbot.com/article/2451320/how-to-use-your-android-tablet-as-a-second-laptop-screen.html). Granted the hdmi isn't an option but if you can live without that then it'll work. Also, there are plenty of full HD tablets.
NZDF doesn't have Navaras anymore, we swapped for Tritons but it does look like the NZDF custom green the Navaras were so potentially an ex-nzdf Ute.
Is greensleeves in LoTR or something? Every time I hear it, it reminds me of either LoTR or Harry Potter
Pounamu is greenstone. It isn't a certain cut or shape of greenstone, just the stone itself.
Your mates were talking shit. You can join, and even have prior experience carried over from other auscanzukus counties if you have so little as NZ residency. Having citizenship is a better green light. Call recruiting and they'll be able to help. Don't be disillusioned by your prior experience though, we're a lot more chilled out and in all honesty see a lot less combat than you're used to. In fact we've pulled out of most large scale operations
Didn't the greens stand up for themselves when that dude said we should fight Ebola with homoeopathy?
No, they said it **doesn't** happen in Australia, you moron. They said "we wait at the lights for them to turn green in Australia and New Zealand" (paraphrase). The only place this appears to happen is in the USA.
It's wolverine and what is *supposed* to be a green plastic army man
Confirmed. We have a similar system here and I need my fiancee to tell me the rough area of a green light. Once I get closer I can focus on one.
The one asked by u/greenw40 higher up.
An alternate reality, somewhat-near-future cyberpunk noir film with rogue human-born creations and a green-less Los Angeles.
Actually, these glasses work best for anomalous trichromats. Dichromats have a smaller likelihood of them working for them, especially if they have protanopia. Right now, Enchroma glasses work best for those with the green-cone defect.
Neat. Why the green background?
Lightning doesn't really turn sand into window glass. It turns it into [fulgurite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulgurite) or [trinitite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinitite). Which is pretty similar to ~~[malachite](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/steven-universe/images/b/b2/MalachiteFullBody.png/revision/latest?cb=20150731221021)~~ *cough cough* sorry, the magical [malachite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malachite) in TES. You can't really turn regular malachite into super cool green glassy weapons!
As someone who is colourblind, I can be somewhat positive that birds can be green.
Is this the "runaway" part of "runaway greenhouse effect"?
I think I miss one in three green men since I've moved to London.
In Sweden at night the lights turn green when there is no one else around. It's a fantastic feeling when the light turns green just for me.
It confuses me because "vert" means "green" in french.
Funny you should said that, and I suppose you're from the USA. I feel like it's the opposite here in europe (and by extension with japanese cars). The 80's were just fantastic, or at least they were for people like me. (fans of little sportscars like the golf GTI). Car manufacturers could put lots of power in little FWH, while not caring of the MPG and the emissions of CO². Then in the 90's, the governments started "thinking green", forcing manufacturers to build eco-friendly-bullshit cars, lowering the power, the sensations, yada yada... Only a few brands kept making those kind of cars, but not anything near the diversity you could witness in the late 70's and 80's. Anyway, as for the present days it's kinda coming back, the state of mind is still not the same, but some manufacturers do care about driving pleasure and doing little cheap sportscars (the BRZ/GT86 being the most obvious exemple). **TL;DR: The best cars in europe comes from the 80's**
Labour has a very different event than the other parties. Everyone sitting down, no drinks. I think I would prefer the greens, or act (they have a nice venue)
Girl screaming at the greens speech. SHUT THE FUCK UP.
Man its rich of journalist to try to make the assumption that politicians will become super spreaders when they have been needlessly traveling everywhere during all alert levels. I understand that the media is important, but some of the travel they did could have been video calls, or green screens.
Well damn, I should have fully read the article. I gave after they talked about the greens co-leader.
So I think there is something wrong with the intersection I was just at. We were trying to turn right, but waited for about 15 minutes for the light to go green. Thanks Auckland Transport!!
Is there a break in the sane behind the hole? Or do you have to walk through the bunker to get to the green?
Me going for the green in 2 on a par 5.
How did you get you hitting an approach and the ball landing on the green for the same shot?
Wow, in all my years golfing I've never seen tire marks on the green. That's fucked up.
a) Can you declare any ball unplayable, even if it is clearly playable? b) This would lead to him hitting another shot downhill on an extremely fast green, which would most likely end with him hitting it way down the slope again, anyway.
The day is about him and his wife, not your school rivalry. That being said, I wore some MSU socks to a wedding so I could flash some green when I wanted to, but most of the time they couldn't be seen.
What's a pro golfer doing throwing a club on the green anyway?
As a fellow MSU student, I can honestly say that they practically send you your first parking ticket with your acceptance letter. Also, I'm colorblind, so the "MSU" looks green to me.
It's slightly more difficult noticing green pixels. They're not as bad as completely unlit pixels. I immediately noticed an unlit pixel almost dead center on a second Vive I purchased a couple of days ago from an online retailer. How do these avoid QC? I didn't just buy a Viewmaster with pocket money! I popped the headset back into the box and arranged a free collection and refund under the DSR. I'm now ordering a replacement and hoping.
My [[[Lord Windgrace](https://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/fortress-windgrace/)]] lands deck. Turns out green is more than just boring fatties.
Holy christ, $5 dollars? Let me make a deal with you. Ill bring you 2 logs of Stokers, you bring me two of Kodiak Wintergreen and we'll meet in the middle lol
So pissed! You have no idea, brother. Although the lack of t tops do make it easier to pack a lip of Kodiak Wintergreen without the wind making a mess of it, so that's a plus!
Occasionally, I'll zone out and stop at green lights. It's only happened once in the last year but it embarrasses me
Toxic fallout in europe got bad so they moved to greenland duh
Cats eat greenies? TIL Too bad mine had to get her teeth taken out
Yeah, nobody really cares because we all know that it's green.
You all have prob seen it but here's the [oregano](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https://fsmedia.imgix.net/6f/fd/68/f5/211b/43dd/bc62/ce9278275c82/this-is-fine.png?auto%3Dformat%252Ccompress%26dpr%3D2%26w%3D600&amp;imgrefurl=https://www.inverse.com/article/19181-kc-green-this-is-fine-dog-meme-this-is-not-fine-kickstarter&amp;tbnid=chZG9jRz2yfatM&amp;vet=1&amp;docid=5lUSw4sAtVDLxM&amp;w=1200&amp;h=1774&amp;q=this+is+fine&amp;source=sh/x/im) anyways
Some people actually think Pepe is a racist or mysoginist character because it's very popular on 4Chan (greentexts and shit). The other day I was on a discord server with a peepoHappy profile picture and the devs asked me to change it because it was against the rules lmao. Anyway I don't think this is the reason for the guys in the clip
I’m colorblind and the green is much easier for me see. I didn’t choose the tacticool life. The tacticool life chose me.
I managed to snag a green dot eotech for $600. It’s really hard to cancel those savings. I’ve been going back and forth on the idea of that for a couple weeks.
Just got a reply from my last email from him. He reshipped my order because USPS “loses things sometimes.” Anyway, the new shipment, he left out of green dot eotech which he’s currently having a sale on. I honestly have zero fucking idea what’s going on. I just want my shit.
Wdym? They still make green crayons!
*passes green crayon*
If I'm behind a car at a traffic light, I will always try to accelerate along with them when it turns green (not start accelerating when they're already off), to make the traffic flow as smoothly as possible.
Did you actually watch the event or are you just talking from what you heard? Agge reverted the players to their positions as soon as he realized he had Marcelo at CAM. It happened to him because he forgot and made modifications to the tactic in a way it triggers the bug, unlike the rest of the pros throughout the event. Do you want the commentators to speak live about a bug without the greenlight from EA? Is that really what you are suggesting?
Still, not the same having an article greenlighted at As than at El Pais, ot goes through different gatekeepers.
Different shades of green probably and mowing marks. To make it a little bit more... lived in, so to speak.
Haha ;) The downside of dedicated servers is the dodgy ping and playing against someone with bad connection would still be terrible. In this case, I prefer P2P, however, EA should provide a better way for us to see how our connection matches up with the opponent's such as a ping meter or making the green bars trustworthy.
Sheffield United away kit is bright green, so it's pretty unique.
Yes, but because RicRod is on LB, putting Naldo next to him if he has a 4* weak foot is better if you have a bit of green-link-OCD. I was just stating that there's no problem with playing him there.
Oh yeah, I forgot about reading how Duality changes with monk philosophy. I only saw the flavor text and so only took the listed stats into account. It should definitely be a pretty nice pair of handwraps then. A named shuriken probably would have caught my interest regardless of its stats since I do love doing shuricannon builds and using fury shot + 4 shurikens in one throw + improved precise shot (or older powerful things *cough* arcane archer imbue *cough*). So I wasn't too offput by having to build up 100 stacks since I knew it wouldn't be too bad with max throw speed and 2, 3, or 4 shurikens every throw. Actually the only tier 3 legendary greensteel item I've completed is a salt shuriken. Since salt doesn't affect bosses, it's a no-brainer for me to switch to Spite against them. But if you're saying that it also *scales*, then I might be in love!
At that point why even wait for green... Now that I think about it, waiting for green actually increased the risk of an accident, if you hadn't noticed and accelerated quickly you could have hit them.
I know, I was asking if it was the freshly painted auger that got green all over his hands. Not really a necessary question but I thought I'd ask.
Ah so that's what the green is from?
My little green friend!
I'm 97% convinced the green goblin is in there or something
Yeah people down here only really use horns if you're about to hit somebody, you can tell when somebody is from up north/out west because they'll honk their horns in a traffic jam or a planck second after the light turns green
Ik had verwacht dat het allemaal greenscreen zou zijn. Valt weer mee dan.
Some new buildings get them. I think it's a great idea, especially in cities, so you get some green space. Also seen now on [bus stops](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/bus-stop-plants-green-roof-bees-holland-utrecht-a8997581.html) in The Netherlands
they decided [already back in 1991](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/nov/25/what-can-the-world-learn-from-vaxjo-europes-self-styled-greenest-city) that they wanted to become fossil fuel free.
tnx. didn't know that was green
I can imagine that there’s a lot of greenscreen used in this shot
affirmative, and most EDH is casual in nature, resulting in green being over represented.
Oh bugger, I was hoping for an orb weekend. Is 2x greens confirmed or just speculated at the moment?
Oh crap, I was really hoping for an orb weekend tomorrow. Can't complain about double greens though.
Utterly trivial min/maxing question: - I need ice and neo orbs, I don't need fire and earth as much. - I'm going to clear the Relm event during exp daily. - I'm going to have enough stamina for a + clear of ice/neo, but not ++. Should I max out greens by carrying extra stamina into fire/earth++, or get extra orb drops from ice/neo+?
Did they give an explanation for the green sky thing?
Any of those green/micronutrient powders worth it? I don't have much of a fridge right now so storing vegetables is next to impossible and I feel like canned green beans can only offer so much.
Uuh I'd say about 50-75g. A lot of my carbs come from canned beans out of convenience and the rest of the fiber comes from greens, fruit, and the skins on potatoes.
* Stronghold Kingdoms - 1462 hours * Team Fortress 2 - 1450 hours * Counter-Strike: GO - 138 hours * Town of Salem - 134 hours * Age of Empires III - 90 hours * Stardew Valley - 56 hours I don't think it'll ever reach #1 but who knows! You'd think with how excited I was 3 or 4 years ago when it was still being greenlit, I'd have invested a **lot** more time into it.
Rushdown Zangief. m.greenhands all day. When I light SPD them, I forward dash once, do another m.greenhand while they're waking up, and then do another light SPD. I can usually do it twice in a row before they figure out how to counter it, but my record is 4.
Thanks for your input! I think I was trying to do an ex greenhand when I did the lariat. I'll occasionally screw up the input, which just means I need to practice the motion in the training room more. And I think I was trying to block when I jumped back but because I use analog, I messed up. Basically I really need to go back to practicing basic motions.
Well I'm still sort of a beginner in general, so what I really want to ask is "How do I Zangief," but I guess to narrow it down: * What are some abridged/easy combos I can pick up on? (Ex: Dudley's cr.hk &gt; ducking upper is quick and simple, gives you practice for EX MGB &gt; ducking upper, and is an okay punish for a beginner to use. * What full combos should I be practicing first, and how would you personally prioritize them? * What are some punishes I should be using? * What should I be spending my meter on, and when? * How do I deal with projectiles? Should I back up and lariat to build meter, or should I FADC through them to get closer? * What should I do immediately after getting in with a green-hand?
Sorry if this has already been asked but have you tried to get it greenlit for steam or anything?
Wait, the dog was painted green? (I'm colourblind)
But I am among the green eyed.
TIL those envelopes are green.
Thought it was green too at first. Source: am colorblind.
I did not check, the obstetrician checked when we hit the ER doors before getting the green light to go to l&amp;d. Should have clarified.
the point of it all is a good, thorough pt hx. then err on the side of caution after contacting OLMC. in my experience, if you contact them, and you seem to have a brain in your head, they'll give you the green light for just about anything.
Not sure. Definitely linear. They're not the MX style with the + posts. They're kinda green looking.
Nothing but the best for our boys in green.
I have protonomaly and they work brilliantly. Green traffic lights are actually green!
Passport, greencard, and social just to be safe. It's all staying with me all the time.
It would be nice if I could get some in my size that weren't a horrid green.
I'm going to guess you were playing A Wonderful Life, or maybe Magical Melody. Anyway, don't think of this game as Harvest Moon. It's not. Or, well, it is; but it wasn't developed by the same company/creators that brought you your past beloved titles. Slowly but surely you'll unlock more townspeople and vendors, one of them being the doctor/scientist. He'll tell you all about insta-buildings and give you the first one on the house: a barn. After placing this barn you'll unlock Hunter the animal vendor (and bachelor if you're playing as the female MC.) From there you can start having a real farm (or whatever you wanna call it since you can't water more than one crop at a time.) Cheer up! The game only starts to get good once you're able to see some greenery. That's when you can focus more on designing your land, getting married, mining, teaching certain skills to your animals, etc. There's some fun in this game; you just have to know where to find it. If you're absolutely dreading it, though, just know that the **real** Harvest Moon (Story of Seasons) is right around the corner.
I do every time I drive on either the Baltimore or DC Beltway. I imagine all the things * Merging * Cars not braking when the road is anything less than perfectly straight * All cars moving immediately when a light turns green * The lack of lights when there is no need for pedestrian crossing because SDCs will be able to detect each other * Not worrying about the car next to me creeping into my lane for the 68th time because the person is texting/putting on make up/shaving/reading the newspaper
It's certainly more than fiber, although that's an interesting point. I'm going to ask about that at dinner tonight. And you are absolutely right that there is no way this is going to help this child. That's just nonsense, but I just wanted to share that a good diet with lots of dark leafy green vegetables does seem to help in the inhibition of certain cancers.
Hold up a second. The American Institute for Cancer Research disagrees a bit. While true it won't prevent cancer (on a long enough time line cancer will get all of us), leafy greens vegetables can help inhibit/prevent some types of cancer    (Source)[http://www.aicr.org/foods-that-fight-cancer/foodsthatfightcancer_leafy_vegetables.html]
Do you have any idea what it takes to become a citizen? Or get a green card? It's brutal even for highly skilled individuals. The U.S. needs to make a path to immigration more streamlined. Immigtation shows a positive ROI on the economy and immigrants also do not contribute to crime as much as citizens. And yes, these figures include both legal and illegal immigration. When there was a call for halring refugees, I was one of the citizens who pushed my mayor (Baltimore) to welcome refugees and more immigrants into our city. The problem isn't the immigrants. It's the U.S. screwed up processes
Sure, but when you go home, you leave work behind you. Some jobs, like those of a politician, the shit never ends. You're never really off. I'm an executive at an IT company and I'm never really off. On vacation? Email and my phone comes with me. Night time with my wife? Email from the CEO that can't wait. Metaphorical fires that need to be put out in another country? You can't wait until morning because they won't be working then. Granted, I never want to go back to the fast food job I had 20 odd years ago, but the grass is always greener. At least once a day, I wish I was an individual contributor who could just do their job, punch out, and not have to think about work until the morning.
I think [this is a good side-by-side comparison of Sanders and Johnson](http://presidential-candidates.insidegov.com/compare/35-39/Bernie-Sanders-vs-Gary-Johnson). It really doesn't make sense that if someone supported Sanders based on issues (unless they are a one issue voter) they would support Johnson. Fundamental differences: Keeping God in the Public Sphere EPA Regulations Making voter registration easier Absolute right to own a gun Expanding the ACA School Vouchers Prioritizing green energy Stimulus better than market backed recovery Higher taxes on the wealthy Privatize social security Support and expand free trade Supporting American Exceptionalism These are two very different candidates. I have no idea why a Johnson supporter would think I could support their candidate as a former Sanders donor and likewise, why a former Sanders supporter would vote Libertarian Edit: Fixed the missing link

I've mentioned it elsewhere, but I can see some green like the green of grass and leaves on a tree, but they are more muted than when I wear the glasses
No, I could see some green of the grass, but now it is a lot more vibrant. The tree leaves stand out now instead of being this kind of muddy background.
No, leaves look green...or at least what I perceive leaf green to be. When I wear the glasses the leaves are a little more vibrant than they were before. Instead of this muted type background, leaves from different leaves actually have different tones
It's really great! I'm about to grab a beer, sit on my deck, and just soak in all of the new green I can see.
That's not it at all. It's to prevent communication to the coaches. The Patriots could have *legally* videoed from that spot if the cameraman was wearing his lime green vest
Are you suggesting that, if I'm carnivore, I'm perfectly fine to enjoy some... green tea?
I walk an hour each way through London to and from work, and I probably see it 3 times a week. A couple of weeks ago I was crossing a three lane carriageway (at a green man) and while 2 of the lanes had stopped, a car came down the third and *almost* hit me as it went through at around 40mph. I honestly get the feeling that at some point I will be hit by a vehicle.
Why is he green?
Nope. Knowing Apple's secrecy they wouldn't be testing devices outside their campus until the eleventh hour before launch, and when they are they certainly wouldn't be testing it with a fluorescent green strap which screams 'look at me!'
Whilst it's a few years old, Greenpeace has a Tuna League table, and it was actually the brand names that came out at the bottom of the pile. [Link](http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/tunaleaguetable)
You're trying to be green? "Approval needed.'
Looks like Cersei will not be the green eyes that Arya gets to shut.
Amen brother (1960). Hate Minions with a passion and I spent many a night staring at a green screen making a routine work. Printing out a giant Bugs Bunny in AACII art on a dot matrix printer was cool in the 70s.
The jury is still out on what exactly denotes BRG. The term is from motorracing and it merely means cars racing for Britain were to be green, just green. In the beginning, lighter greens were used. The really dark greens were first used by Bentley.
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want He makes me down to lie Through pastures green he leadeth me the silent waters by With bright knives he releaseth my soul He maketh me to hang on hooks in high places He converteth me to lamb cutlets For lo, he hath great power and great hunger When cometh the day we lowly ones Through quiet reflection and great dedication Master the art of karate Lo, we shall rise up And then we'll make the bugger's eyes water.
I have always said that if I ever moved to Stralya, I'd concrete the garden completely and paint it grass-green. Further, I'd build a wall around everything with razor-wire on top, and have it painted to look like a hedge. Problem solved.
This is something done a lot in Germany. They call the resulting 'evergreen' a 'green wave'. The disadvantage is, the cycle needs to change slowly that the other direction can also benefit from the green wave. When I drive to work in the morning and leave before 4:30, I get a green wave over 3 lights to where I join the autobahn. If I leave home after 4:30, I have to speed to catch the wave. After 5, I stop at all the lights.
If it was green text, the frog would have no difficulty
Nice shape and ratio of high to low density, but I dont see much green space or many 'interesting' details, it's just a little too clean, you know 7/10
Yes. They are green.
St. John's and Fish oil and Melatonin are for depression. B vitamin complex and Co Enzime Q10 are for CFS. The rest are for general health. I also drink green tea.
Salsa verde, green pepper sauce.
There was no mess. Just some dust, and an ugly green pastic bowl on the kitchen counter. I mentioned it on r/landlord. She didn't even open the blinds properly.
I personally use greenify and lspeed with root, and it mostly helps with battery life and network traffic tweaks respectively
Back in 2003 my parents didn't know what to invest into. I was 13 years old, I loved Apple products and believed Google had potential... told them: "I think you should buy Apple and Google!".  I also thought someone should do an online platform where users could upload their videos for everyone to see. Not only that, I actually made one: it was a green webpage with my email address, asking people if they could send me some videos, and I'd publish them there. Macromedia Dreamweaver and free FTP hosting were the shit!  I had this weird fetish for videoclips, started collecting them through the internet... searched for a portable device that could hold em, eventually mobile phones caught up but there still too little. Searched for a mini-TV or something, but the only available solutions were clunky. I really believed Apple would solve this problem!
Customer testimonials with pics is one of those alarm bells that screams bullshit to me. Lengthy text introductions with multiple fonts, photo of the owner in a circle, call to action button at the bottom of the page, with an email field, RECEIVE IT FOR FREE! and get an email with the link, 100% satisfied or refunded, with a big green verified symbol.  That’s like the template to sell horseshit, seen many times.
I'm having the same problem: it manifest if you go fullscreen by double clicking the video after opening it. Using the fullscreen button it doesn't become green.
This is exactly my argument. Except I don't think it's only philosophy but psychology as well (and, for some, spirituality).  It is truly interesting to discuss what drives people actions. But as long as these actions can be judged to produce a desiderable outcome (such as feeding people or promoting green energy) it is really meaningless to attack those who are doing them on the basis of their egoism.
As a resident in the area, holy shit my neighbours are whiners. You can't have the pros of living beside greenspace/old growth without some drawbacks (mosquitoes, coyotes, etc). You bought outside the greenbelt, now shut up and stop making us look all NIMBY-y...
I swear they told me ten years when I renewed last week, but from the ministry's FAQ page: "Your photo health card has an expiry date that is linked to your date of birth. The first time you apply for a photo health card, the expiry date can be anywhere from two to seven years in the future. When your photo health card is renewed, the renewal date will always be five years in the future and linked to your date of birth." So maybe they were just trying to convince me to finally kick over to the green card by lying? Dunno.
Congrats! As an ex-IBMer myself (got the ax during layoffs 4 years ago), I can firmly say I don't miss it. I don't miss the bullshit, the long hours with no compensation, or having to "play the game" to get ahead. The only thing I miss is my team, but most of them have left for greener pastures over the past few years anyway. That place is just toxic.
He made a [really good milk stout](http://beaus.ca/beer/the-tom-green-beer/) with one of the local breweries up here in Eastern Ontario, but yeah, i'd agree he's pretty irrelevant at this point.

In the end, I respect your right to differing opinion, I just take exception to you thinking this is just Canada. Its akin to me blaming the world economy's issues on the EU due to troubles in Greece, Portugal, Ireland, etc. I think both issues show the difficulty of doing **anything** in today's globalized world. Case and point, China IS leading the world in green initiatives, however most are spearheaded by foreign corporations, rather than the government itself. Until these companies that are actually **producing** these emissions are dealt with, they'll just keep bending the rules to make a buck.
I'm not entirely sure, but I think it may have to do with the [priority system for emergency vehicles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_signal_preemption). It allows them to change lights as they approach. Is it about 100-200m from an intersection? I know OC transpo also uses a similar (RF or something) technique to switch lights - good example is coming out of Bayshore Westbound - light at Acres always seems to go green just as the bus pulls up. If not... well... you know, [Aliens.](http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/photos/images/original/000/158/329/9189283.jpg)
So after viewing this image several times today, I just realized the guy in a green adidas-style pullover near the end of the line is a coworker and friend of mine... Ottawa is WAY too small.
For those who struggle with knowing whether to use “affect” or “effect” then here are two helpful tips: The greenhouse **E**ffect **A**ffects the environment. Alternatively, if you don’t know which to use in a sentence then change whatever you’ve typed to “acted upon.” If the sentence still makes sense then you know to use “affect” in place of “acted upon” because it is a verb (action word). The loud sound (effects) hurt my hearing The loud sound (act upon) hurt my hearing * this doesn’t make sense so we know to put “effects” instead.
He’s using a green screen and wearing a green hat...at certain angles, the top of his head completely disappears😂😂 I hope Shure didn’t send him that unit to review. Jesus Christ that was bad.
Hard to even guess. I certainly didn’t see a green day cover coming😂
Okie here's a story from my residence at university. It's thanksgiving (Canada) and the meal hall made a turkey dinner in the usual buffet style. I had my share, potatoes and Turkey. After eating I went back to my friend's room and hang out-I think we played MK9. When everyone's leaving I decided I wanted to have a shower (it was at least 11:00pm). I went to the washroom (it wasn't a communal washroom) with my towel wrapped around my waist and a bag full of my usual bathroom stuff. I walk into the small washroom and notice a pretty bad smell. I thought nothing of it, it was probably the bleach that the cleaners use everyday in the showers. I brush my teeth and the smell is still pretty noticeable. 'Whatever, I can deal'. I walk closer to the shower-the shower curtain was drawn-and I notice that the smell got stronger. 'It must be the bleach' I thought to myself. I drew the curtain and I see the most horrifying sight of my life. Vomit everywhere in this tiny 3x3x6.5 (guesstimate) cubicle. The smell wasn't even the worst part. It looked like someone had exploded and turned into this green chunky ooze. It wasn't just localized to one spot in the shower. It was everywhere and it looked thick. Needless to say I only got a brief look at it before I grabbed my stuff and bolted out the door, towel wrapped around me. I couldn't believe what I just saw. I insisted on not suffering alone on this and so I had my roommate and my friend also go through the same experience. I woke up the next morning to the cleaning lady wretching, cursing and vomiting also. I didn't use that shower again that year-no matter how many times it was cleaned.
Just thought I'd point out that when you're colourblind, your squad mates won't be green (protanopia, Deutranopia, Tritanopia)
You're not wrong. After college I quit to a new company every year for 4 years. Every time I left for greener pastures I had a better job for more pay. Don't settle for a shitty workplace. If you're unsatisfied with your job look for a new one. Of course this is easy for me to say because I'm single with no kids. But the principle remains true.
I mean she did lead her father to his death and allied herself with the enemy of giant green monsters. From their point of view she's basically the worst.
I stand by it. The complaining is 100% pointless. Grass is always greener type situation.
I find it funny you chose that euphemism. "The grass is always greener" is one of the cornerstones of sarcastic expressions. Maybe the grass is slightly greener, but it's not nearly as green as the folks in these comments seem to think. Druid is a pretty easy class to play. Lots of roles you can fill. Not too many buttons to press. It's fun and relaxing. But people in this thread are acting like it's as strong as priests in vanilla.
That is not an order I've ever seen. Calling the arena a square, and referencing Cenarius starting point as the "top" this is what my group does. Top left x2, Top right, Top left. By this point you should be phased. Top left cleanses wisps, which puts the small spots of green around the room. This allows ranged and healers (and the tank on the ads) to cleanse easily without running in to the main green pool. Top right cleanses the treant which replenishes healer mana. This was mostly needed in progression, probably not necessary anymore. Cleansing a dragon (bottom left) makes ads easier to handle (since you don't have two dragons to deal with). The logic behind the stack point is "which ad are we cleansing?" Every ad has a negative effect if not cleansed, and a positive effect if cleansed. You can read them in the adventure journal and see why specific ads are chosen. The benefit of cleansing wisps is great, and the consequences of not cleansing them is a little hectic, which is why wisps are always cleansed.
How on Gods green earth would I have searched for this?
But consider his character aesthetics too. His default scheme is green, he is very satyr like, he even has hooves. And his name is Oberon...
Maybe on the surface. OP and myself (I'm the green commenter) spent all night answering his questions. Had he been in the room with me I'd have choked him to death.
We are giving him a chance. If he shows up with his father, his field fee, and proper gear he'll play. We're not unfair, but players need to make some effort on their own to learn. As field operators we cannot spoonfeed every. single. answer. I'm the guy commenting in green btw.
We almost didn't. I'm the guy talking in green, and i pm'd him several times suggesting that he maybe not come if it was inconvenient for his parents, etc.. He never responded. Just kept commenting with more questions.
It's beautiful here, so much green.
Actually its not too bad. End government restrictions to allow nuclear power, a far more green alternative to green house gases.
Just started my night sesh with a vmod. Had it for two weeks now and haven’t had to charge it at all; still on green. Keep in mind I only use it at night but whatever it rips and looks clean Fuckin love those things

"Peanut butter ISN'T green!? What!?"
I just canceled the wrong card. Took an upgrade offer to biz plat last June, downgraded it in February to Biz Green when the AF hit, and just canceled it via chat meaning to cancel a personal green. Since the upgrade offer was &lt; a year ago I’m worried they’ll clawback. Any ideas on what I should do? Can I reinstate?
There’s no reload cost on the green Serve.
That happened to my p2. About 2months later got her a Hilton Biz, two weeks after that got BBP and biz green at the same time.
Same thing happened with my p2 on a biz green and a 2 month relationship. I’m assuming paying a few statements will do the trick but not sure what the magic number is. You can always recon and say you’re trying to build the right baseline of cards for personal and business use and see if they go for it but I imagine the first two bullets are the sticking points.
You can’t refer to Schwab plat. So referring biz green gets the 5k for one purchase plus the 20k referral bonus for 30k plus the 50 from BGR plus 60 from Schwab. And you’ll likely get 10 from green even though it says 5. EDIT: plus the 15k you get referring from your biz plat.
BGR -&gt; Biz Green, Schwab Plat. 135k minimum, possibly 140 if the green bug happens. EDIT: forgot the 15k for referring to BGR. So 150-155k.
Was the biz green her first MR earning card? How long ago?
No you can’t self refer for the Amazon biz card. You’re not “taking” green, you’re getting 25-30k free points by self referring. Applying for both is fine. If you have a BGR you likely won’t get an HP on the Amex. Is 50k MR for 2k spend and a 5/24 slot worth it to you?
Known bugs. Ghost in the machine. 20k for BGR referral, 5k green rewards welcome bonus, 5k bus green fpb bonus.
What DPs are you looking for? I got my BGR 50k bonus on the 10th, a 20k self refer bonus a week later, and 2x5k bonuses for biz green yesterday.
Had a fun productive morning. I had a semi spent USB VGC and got my first MO at a local grocery (grabbed another GC while there with self checkout on p2’s). Walgreens had restocked their OVVGC so p2 got me one there too. Headed to one of the 5 friendly WMNMs in the area to finish off my Serve max for the month and the MC cashier said “oh I remember you! I should just let you get back here and do these.” Yes please.
Amex biz plat this week Hilton Aspire 12/24 when I get out of 2/90 2nd CIP Jan 15 before Amex reports the Aspire 2nd Citi AA biz if I can get a mailer Cooling it on p2 right now, she just got denied for a biz green (but is working on MSR for BGR and SPG Biz). Maybe will try for a 2nd CIP on her around Christmas or at the same time as mine.
Holy shit, biz green here I come!
Local grocery store owned by Kroger. Or a Walgreens.
Akorns are awesome. I’ve owned two and now use a big green egg. The Akorn is absolutely comparable, just slightly tougher to stabilize below 250°. That said, a roll of nomex can do wonders.
Smoke it low to 165, make collard greens.
Half a city block explodes in green flame, *green flame*! All hell is breaking loose.
You're a god damned champion, a saint, and king among Ents. I salute you muckraker62, and will have you tagged forevermore as "Gives Gifts of Deliciousness". In green.

It should not be possible to get the green ranger v2 skin anymore.
Np. If you pre-order either version you will also get the green ranger v2 skin that is exclusive to people who pre-order the game. The deluxe edition also comes with the season 1 pass which is the first 3 dlc characters.
So what villages aren't in this game? I saw Pokke, and yukumo, and a third one, none of the mh4u villages and not moga, but still, Also is it just me or does the glasslike green dragon totally look like brachydios turned into a cocoon and then hatched as a butterfly dragon thing.
I doubt it since it would mean that the Advanced, the Defender, the Fighter and the Phantom would all get green K-Turns. One green K-Turn would be bad enough but if all of those ships got it the game would be beyond repair.
Tfw Iceland is green and Greenland is ice.
Can you imagine last year's green cancer meta with this year's battle pass? Hory shieeet, this sub would have to be locked.
You’re absolutely right. There is a staggering degree of hypocrisy. But the past is the past, we are not our ancestors and the looming threat of ecological collapse is an objective reality. It doesn’t stall itself for any nation. It is completely unfair that the developing nations don’t get the same advantage the more developed and industrialised nations do but we simply cannot have more countries following suit with this wanton and thoughtless destruction. It’s my understanding that there are provisions in the Paris Accord stipulating that more economically developed nations should aid the less developing ones to meet their goals in greener methods by helping to foot the bill, provide resources etc. Though I’m unsure to what extent that’s actually done in practice. But committing to deals like this is the way forward. We cant keep profligately reaping the earths resources as we have done in the past just for the sake of principle. Two wrongs unfortunately don’t make a right.
You need to surrender to the fact that you wont be able to save the world single handedly. A noble but unrealistic expectation. I understand this feeling of hopelessness. Believe me. But the world is so vast. All we can realistically expect of ourselves is to do our parts and lead by example. Hoping we inspire as many people to live up to their responsibilities through our actions. As the famous saying goes: Be the change you want to see in this world. Espouse this sense of environmental responsibility in your actions. Through mindfulness of your consumption habits, minimising the amount of waste and emissions you produce and disposing the waste you do produce responsibly (composting food waste, recycling, etc). Educate yourself and others. Also try to find a career in a green industry. There are plenty of new companies that are trying to be part of the solution. It’s quite amazing actually. When you put yourself out there you will realise how many like minded people there are out there trying to make a positive difference. We’re living in a time of “moral awakening”. Many young people are passionate about preserving the world we live in. It’s not all doom and gloom my friend. Also donate and join environmental activist groups. There are many groups that advocate green environmental policies and are active about it. Calling corporations and governments out on their bullshit practices. Greenpeace are a great global organisation. But I’m sure there are many other great organisations in Germany. Good luck!
What's green and has wheels? Grass. I lied about the wheels.
To quote my first response, “OP, you need a green 2 way splitter. Known as a Directv 2 way splitter, or a SWiM 2 way splitter. With the power passing side of the splitter going towards your power inserter or genie, if it’s a 54 model.” I also commented directly to your post with a link to a picture.
I’ve don’t that when the person I was behind had waiting extremely long the past 2 lights. So I honked the second it turned green. I was really proud of the ugly look she gave me when I later passed her.
They just flooded me with their numbers. Every dwarf unit had atleast 2 greenskin units to fend off. My artillery got rushed by cav and quarrellers were busy with reinforcing. They had stalk units too which came visible to me when they were on my artillery.
I'm playing as Bretonnia and they are my military allies. They're actually helping me with the greenskins in the mountains
What about the greenwashing they did tho? Imma stick with Evian
Focus on PBing (perfect blocking). Its important to staying alive in intermediate level duels, and absolutely essential in higher levels. PBing is when you move your mouse cursor to match the direction of the incoming attack. You will know you've perfect blocked an attack when the cursor flashes green. You will take no BP damage and with some styles will drain the opponents BP by doing so. Its also necessary to manual block/disarm people if you are interested in that.
Haven't loaded up the binary yet, but man this looks like quite the hidden gem. I really dig the orbital mechanics map simple-green aesthetic. Will be keeping an eye on this. Is there anywhere else besides Patreon we can follow updates? How about the possibility of open-source to allow contributors? I would be very interested in contributing possibly.
No I'm stuck with the idea that Kylo will come back to the lightside. He'll get his grandfather's lightsaber after all. Kylo using Luke's green saber just doesn't make sense to me.  I love the idea of Rey using a double-bladed. Fits really well, better than a single hilt.
Because PSVR devs are green.
Firstly, VR games don't need to be greenlit. Secondly, how in the world are basketball games supposed to work in VR? Shooting hoops is hard enough in real life when you can feel the weight of the ball. It must be nigh-impossible to do in it VR.
Sith robes with a green saber? You make me sick. /s
The camo pattern in this picture looks more green than the camo pattern in the OP picture. Would be interested to see it on though. The files for retexture are avaliable for anyone to use.
I had no idea there was a green screen in H4
How dare you insult green-kind master race!!
As someone who is /r/colorblind, that peanut butter is green.
And the story you posted is from the National Review. Hardly a non-partisan source. It might as well be Bartbreit these days. I find it interesting that you're now a Trump defender when you and I agreed many times that Trump is wholly unfit to lead this country during the primaries.

We were a bit wary at first, too. But, [Brad Green](https://twitter.com/bradlygreen), Google's Angular team lead, has said it is stable enough to go ahead and start using it in prod. At that point, we decided to go for it. About 2 months ago we fleshed out our first Angular2 app, now running in prod. Our experience: I can say we've run into very few issues using Angular2. We built out a "starter app" for our junior developers to use as a beginning point. The starter app is in prod now, and we already have one new app being developed from it. In the browser, there have been no problems. We're using many child components, stores, reactive programming, etc. Building the app has been pretty painless, even when creating a fairly complex application. Testing Angular2 has been a different story. We've had some trouble there. Testing standard services, mocks, factories, models were no problem. The main trouble we have run into is testing components. Just today I found a new issue with testing a child component. The "magic" (read: Annotations) of Angular2 coupled with lack of Angular2 testing documentation makes the learning curve for testing higher. There have only been a few bugs with testing. The trouble is that they're obscure and can be caused by many, many different packages in the stack. So, finding the cause of the bug can be hard. I imagine testing will get easier as more people document how to do it properly. In case someone is interested, this the stack we have in prod right now: package.json { "version": "1.0.0", "description": "A simple project to prove out the use of client side Javascript libraries and methodologies.", "main": "index.js", "scripts": { "test": "karma start --single-run", "build": "webpack &amp;&amp; cp src/index.html dist/", "server": "lite-server" }, "devDependencies": { "css-loader": "^0.23.1", "html-loader": "^0.4.3", "jasmine-core": "^2.4.1", "karma": "^0.13.21", "karma-chrome-launcher": "^0.2.2", "karma-firefox-launcher": "^0.1.7", "karma-jasmine": "^0.3.7", "karma-phantomjs-launcher": "^1.0.0", "karma-webpack": "^1.7.0", "lite-server": "^2.1.0", "node-sass": "^3.4.2", "phantomjs-prebuilt": "^2.1.4", "sass-loader": "^3.1.2", "style-loader": "^0.13.0", "ts-loader": "^0.8.1", "typescript": "^1.8.2", "webpack": "^1.12.13", "webpack-dev-server": "^1.14.1" }, "dependencies": { "@ngrx/store": "^1.2.1", "angular2": "^2.0.0-beta.12", "es6-promise": "^3.0.2", "es6-shim": "^0.35.0", "reflect-metadata": "0.1.2", "rxjs": "5.0.0-beta.2", "zone.js": "0.6.6" } } Note: I've removed some identifying company info from the file. :) Having done it now, I'd say I agree with Brad that it is ready for production. We're in pretty deep now, and once you find and work around the few testing issues, it's been a good experience. It should only continue to get easier.
I'm smoking the same strain this week. It's really great. I'm curious -- what state did you get yours? Yours is greener and looks more sticky. Mine's a bit more dry. I live in Denver, Colorado. So, if you're in Denver, then I need to change dispensaries! :)
What time did you go riding? I was on Salado Creek greenway today from 3-6pm. I did 24 miles and then popped my back tire where the trial ends at McAllister. So many friendly people on the trial. I walked it back to the "airport hill" portion of the trial and had several guys stop and ask if I needed help. It was hosed though so I called a cab to take me back to Tobin Park.
I'm colorblind, so that sucks for me. How do I amber light? I already have trouble with green. I guess I'll just be moving over for everyone with any kind of flashing lights...
Evergreenoldboy made me lol. You made me super lol. I love you both, you spectacular bastards! Have upboats! Upboats all around!
Yep it does change most scope reticles from red to yellow/green. I have hard times seeing red reticle on grass.
Yep that was the best red and not overloaded with white (which is what followed with Santander sponsorship).
Yep! My garage growing up also had white on green and white on red plates :) I wonder where those went...
Yep! The red had a lot less seeds than the yellow/orange (I’m colorblind so not quite sure what color they are) but I saved seeds from both
Yep! Unfortunately though the red is too much for me. Good luck selling it though!
Yep. Courts are adding more and more charges to fines these days. Look at [this from California](http://i.imgur.com/zANlaB3.png). A $100 base fine (running a red light) turns into a $549 fine.
Yep. This is one reason why I don't know if I want a new one. My 04 Golf TDI is awesome at night. The blue of the dash in front. The red of the window and lock controls all around. So good.
Yes I am colorblind no I don't see in black and white . There are many types of colorblindness that is monochromatic I have Deuteranomaly aka red green color blind. Yes I can see both red and green . My green cone just doesn't work right. Oh and yes for the 100th time I know about enchroma glasses. No I'm not going to tell you what color 10 random objects are in the room.
Yes I automatically turn down the music as I pull up to red lights.
Yes I know it's red. Maybe it's just a random thing? Though I've done it the same on two platforms now so... there is a way to get it done obviously. Many others have done it as well.
Yes but did Germany also build military bases inside of Russia during the revolution with the aid of the Bolsheviks? Did Germany train Russians and did Germany allow Lenin to use German military officers to command the red army? Or did Lenin do absolutely none of those things and the comparison between the Bolsheviks and Rojava absolutely bullshit?
Yes but we got the M4 platform with an ACOG+red dot sight and even with the red dot it's far better.
Yes he is. Personally I think Bernie is a red deep down. His comment on sneakers and deodorant was pretty revealing.
Yes just upset over pee being a red clay-like substance
Yes most people will have an accident or become ill in their lifetime sure. You don't understand the economics of insurance though. You buy it while you are healthy preparing for the day when you are sick. The average person if they bought private insurance their whole life would lose money not gain equivalent or greater benefits in healthcare. The average person is never supposed to come ahead from purchasing insurance. Your second paragraph starts out with a red herring and continues to not actually address the issue. The funny thing is in your post you claim that health insurance companies have been left to themselves. That just isn't true and if you don't recognize that and the economics of insurance you will never be able to be taken seriously when you debate health insurance.
Yes not much but yes it lasted a good five or ten minutes but I was alright it wasn’t much and I was wearing a red shirt
Yes sir or ma’am. I think I may pick up one if they’re still there. I’m a complete shopaholic and Star Wars can’t scratch that itch rn lol. My only issue with the shin Godzilla one is that he’s red not blue and doesn’t have the cool rhombus mouth lol
Yes the top diagonal is orientated incorrectly. Thin red line should be towards the top of the thick white line.
Yes you can! I picked up 2 copies of X-wings (1 red box 1 blue box) and the new legendary expansion.
Yes! Why Red and Green on ANYTHING? The most common forms of colorblindness have trouble with red and green. Why not Red and Blue? Huh? Easy!
Yes!!! I saw an old Asian woman stopped at a red light. She was about 2 feet over the white line so after about 5 seconds of being stopped she flips it into reverse and slams into the car behind her.
Yes. But that had more to do with the industrial revolution than the civil war. Just look up all the 'religions' and 'philosophies' that were created during that time because simply because of technology fueling nihilism. The religious did not recover until the red scare in the 50s and later Reagan.
Yes. I know because I can't see it due to my colorblindness. So glow-in-the-dark is a type of green that isn't overlapped by the red or blue cones.
Yes. Is your gasoline always orange-red or is it only certain types? Wikipedia says nothing about fuel dyes in the Dominican Republic so I'm guessing you guys just have lower quality gasoline. They have started adding some additives to gasoline in the recent years here so that might be why it's so clear.
Yes. The room only spawns red hearts. It was the same in the original. The heirophant also so do reds
Yes. While it's green you enter and wait. Turn if there's a gap but if it turns orange and red you can complete the turn.
Yes... but you have to remember that the light wouldn't be green for the white car until the light we are seeing was red for about 2 seconds. This means the white car completely blew their light. And the car with the camera would have probably been through the intersection before white car's light turned green.
Yes; there were two red lines in the log (that I can't remember) when I tried to flash it using twrp and then it wouldn't boot into android anymore and only directly into the recovery. No errors at all in cmr. If you don't want to overwrite twrp you could try getting the phone into fastboot mode and run fastboot boot cm-14.1-20161205-NIGHTLY-ether-recovery.img This will boot the robin into the cmr without overwriting twrp and it won't hurt if it fails to boot it. I think if you flash the new cyanognenmod from there it will still boot when you reboot again.  Sorry I never used Titanium Backup myself so I can't really help there. A friend of mine who also owns a robin managed to upgrade from cyanogenmod 13 just by flashing the new version over the old one and then flashing the new gapps but I wouldn't rely on it. Also something to note: flashing gapps doesn't seem to work from cmr so I had to use the fastboot boot method to boot into twrp to flash the gapps after flashing the cm 14.1 nightly with cmr.
Yesterday on my drive home I had a green light but if I would have entered the intersection I would have been blocking it. So the dude behind me (of course an Uber driver) completely goes around me so that *he* can block the intersection instead. And of course the light turned red and he had a whole lane of traffic blaring their horn at him.
Yikes. Lots of red flags already.
Yo can i join you im red milk
Yo mama so fat when something approaches her it slows down and red shifts.
Yo the new red dead 3 trailer looking fire
You’re going to tell me how the colorblindness I have had my entire life works? My eyes are *physically missing* green receptors. The only ranges of green I can see are those that are covered my the blue and red receptors.
You are absolutely distorting this. Obama ordered additional screening of Iraqi refugees which got delayed and held up due to bureaucratic red tape and led to delays. Trump ordered an outright temporary halt of all refugees. Those are in no way the same thing.
You are also wrong. I own a pair of enchroma glasses and I researched the technology extensively before my purchase. http://enchroma.com/technology/ Red green color blindness is caused by the red and green cone's frequency response ranges mostly overlapping. By filtering out frequencies towards the middle of the overlap they improve a viewer's ability to differentiate between red and green.
You are not allowed to camp on Fløyen or in the areas within the red lines on the map.
You are rocking that red! Prepare for this to be stickied and sidebar'd for maximum /tall swoonage ;)
You are wise for this. Some asshole went through a through a red light and almost hit me.. Then I started to cross only to almost get hit again BY THE SAME ASSHOLE only this time he was in reverse! Yes he fucking backed through the same red light he already went through! Philly is a trash hole.
You asked her to drop it and she didn't. That's a big red flag.
You better have wore a red wings jersey today.
You both have major red flags
You can actually get higher than 155 if the referee mistakenly spots a red in lieu of the brown and nobody notices.
You can also save the videos/ songs for offline playback inapp with red. Just required you go online once a month to use the feature. (Presumably to make sure you are still subscribed)
You can buy a right angle/90 degree adapter for your USB c port so that it doesn't block your hand as much. Or buy rog phone/red magic 3 so that you get side ports #ROGphonemasterrace
You can choose what switches to have when you order it atleast on aliexpress (white/brown/red). I grabbed one with kailh box brown. Also wow it's now hotswappable if I am not mistaken
You can do it sir! I believe in you! We need more red transplants like you who won't repeat California's mistakes!
You can find feminists who are focused on how to improve mens lives in a nontoxic way like /r/menslib. Not all of feminism is women with red hair and giant glasses telling you how easy men have it.
You can find support for both positions in the bible (in red letters even)  Luke 22:35-36
You can get a dirty purple flair whenever you want; it takes tremendous patience to get to red.
You can get enough protein from legumes and vegetables. You don't need to mainline red meat just to survive.
You can get watches &amp; clocks with a red side and a blue side that tells you if it’s past the hour or to the hour
You can leave the wolf to much later in the game. Your path forward is between the taurus demon and the red dragon.
You can make right turns on red just about anywhere in the US outside of NYC
You can search for a label on places like discogs [and find all their releases.](https://www.discogs.com/label/30082-Wild-Rags-Records?page=1) There's a couple bands with blood in their name but this [grindcore band named Blood that had a release on red translucent vinyl](https://www.discogs.com/artist/279409-Blood-5) is probably what you're looking for.
You can see the icon for the cuirass. Which tells me it's the best light cuirass in the game as I have a red version of it.
You can still order from him. He has a site now. Search for red house vapor.
You can still tap the red button to toggle the popup.
You can take a left hand turn on red if your going from a one way street onto another one way street. No one knows this and never does.
You can't argue with that. It's a clear red.
You can't at all see the crossover that you're nullifying? You believe everywhere that doesn't allow open carry should make it legal so that if you accidentally have a firearm in the open it isn't illegal? Maybe we should be allowed to run red lights so that it isn't illegal and we don't get fined for accidentally doing it. Or maybe trespass law should be abolished in case you're accidentally on someone's property without permission?
You can't glance to the right side of your screen to assess your building materials before you start building and then wehn you see something is red instead of blue you simply right click once to go to the next material type? It's pretty simple and quick. Also if your reaction time isn't fast enough to stop pressing W when you see the next section is going to be red...
You clearly don’t know the steps to get a gun than. Because it’s pretty strict in most areas unlike what you want to believe anyone who has committed any violent crime can’t get one nor can people who might have other red flags it’s a thing called a “background check”
You could have Crimea blue but with diagonal red lines indicating its disputed status.
You could try out Wijnaldum instead of Fer. His Newcastle card will link with everyone if you don't want to see any red links.
You could turn right on red there until they put in the bus lane.
You could use Echidna to cover red and then get a Kitty Badshynee from Hello Kitty to cover dark.
You could use brown mushrooms instead of red.
You didn't see the red dots at the right-hand end that shoots up? Do you need glasses?
You don't give red packets to your elders and seniors. It goes (roughly) the other way round.
You don't have to put in the red light...
You forgot about little rock drivers. Running red lights like crazy cause they are too busy playing on their phone or something similar.
You forgot your Doctorate in seeing red
You got a link for that wallpaper? I'm doing a red/black theme as well soon ! :)
You got me *red handed* ;]
You had better anodise it red
You have a dark theme that has changed the upvote color. It's most certainly not that red.
You have difficulty with red and blue? You must have a rare colorblindness.
You have more significant problems if your armpit zone is red.
You have my ruby-red Sith light saber!
You have to make the red and green darker so less people can tell
You hear the new red dead game is only 30 FPS? Insane
You in the red shirt ... I want you to live
You just described my childhood. Star Wars exploded in my mind after seeing Attack of the Clones. Like I loved it after seeing the Special Editions at the age of 4 and being blown away by the podrace and the scary red guy with the double lightsabers but AotC is what made me realize the scale of Star Wars and the possibilities the universe held. Man I love Star Wars!!!
You just have to be able to see vivid red and green. Like they showed me two pieces of construction paper and I had to point to which was red and which was green
You keep saying filter... That's not right. If you took red and green light spectrum and put them on a graph essentially what enchroma does is moves the two colors further apart before it hits your eyes. It's not a filter that would imply that it's just a red lense. But I can't grasp the science behind it so you probably know better.
You know that's actually a good idea. I live in a red state so there probably won't be any when I go vote but still.
You know what a red herring is?
You know what's the difference between red states and blue states? Blue states sign the front of checks.
You look like my red dead online character
You lost it. It's ours to break. Besides it's so much nicer in red.
You made the right choice. Because you know deep down that it was right. And it was going south. With mine there was a ton red flags That I ignored. I should have walked away a couple months before shit went down.
You managed to find the one picture of red square not aimed at [Suzzallo](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2279/2306403985_b383f40d38.jpg) which I would have pinned as the most iconic building. [Bonus shot](http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6204/6096943662_749096fee7_z.jpg) of the reading room. [Double bonus shot](http://nwscience.org/wp-content/gallery/sciencewire/512px-univ_of_wash_-_george_washington_statue_02_0.jpg) of George Washington with a large sword.
You may be deuternomally colorblind. I am and brown looking red is common for me.
You may not recognize him with his new red arm.
You mean ==. Eating red meat ≠ vegan. It is one part of the decision to become vegan.
You mean BYR? I start with B Y R R then just B Y from there on. The red grows to stupid levels on its own.
You mean Harry. Explains the red hair.
You mean a gorgeous Emilia in a red dress haha
You mean for the rest of the year? It was definitely red last time.
You mean green red Luigi?
You mean like Second Cup? I actually found one when I was working in Riyadh. They even put a red maple leaf on the logo. Blew my mind.
You mean like a 1cmc mana dork or a 2cmc 3 damage red spell?
You mean red jesus?
You mean the Jets Bills game? That was the one where the Jets green and Bills red looked the same for colorblind people. I can’t think of a type of colorblindness where you would confuse red and yellow. Source: Am colorblind
You mean the red artificially flavoured sticks that you dare to call licorice?
You might like red fang
You most likely have 94% accuracy not inaccuracies 94% is within red and could easily put you at the bottom of a district
You must be the one they make those useless red circles for.  There you go in case you missed it still
You need a modem with pppoa to pppoe bridging like a draytek vigor 120. Most routers only do pppoe and most modems don't do pppoa because they expect the router to handle pppoe. Most ISPs in NZ also only do pppoa with the only exception being Vodafone **only** on their own exchanges (the red network). With the model modem I stated you can trick the routers pppoe credentials into pppoa credentials for the ISP.
You need to turn on colour blind mode. Normally the agents have a red outline if you turn on protanopia mode they have a yellow outline and your issue here will be fixed. It is also possible that you are colourblind if you are having trouble seeing the red outline
You not understanding a joke is a big red flag
You only find them in abandoned sectors which are red.
You only get red glow on top 10
You play differently when you know there are 10 people roaming the zone to kill you. It's pretty exhilarating watching a raid ride past a mountain you scrambled up to hide on. It's also more meaningful when a red bar actually helps you with something (or vice versa).
You red bastard.
You run along the sidewalks and turn right (or left) at every red light so you don't have to stop. :p
You run into things all the damn time in red dead
You see that red lever? - Tony Stark as Iron Man.
You see the break on the power and ground rails (the red and blue lines don't connect)? Those two banks are not connected to one another. So your inverter doesn't have power or ground.
You seem to have removed the upvited and down vote animation. As a colorblind person that was very useful to me because without it I have a hard time seeing the red of the up vote. Is it possible to make it an animation option?
You shoot their bullet down before it hits you. Duh. They did it in red dwarf.
You should be able to shoot fine with scopes and red dots. Looking through a tube takes your left eye out of the equation since it can't see the reticle or dot anyway. You should be fine with peep sights too (the rear peep being so close to your eye should get your brain to prefer it over your dominant eye while aiming). Might be worth it to train left handed for barrel-mounted or AK style sights. Definitely train left handed for using shotguns with bead sights.
You should check out /r/colorblind. It's surprising how often there are stories of people who seem to think being colorblind means you can see through the colors you have trouble with. Also usually colorblindness improves night vision but I guess like me you're red green color blind so reds ends up much darker.
You should have used colors that would confound colorblind people. Maybe a green and red plaid.
You should make sure it's safe to proceed through the red. If a car ignores the fire truck and goes through the green and hits you running the red... It will be a mess trying to argue out of the ticket (potentially) and with the insurance company
You should roll them separate. Something like: /em rolls white dice [[1d20]][[1d20]] /em rolls red die [[1d20]] You CAN change the color of your dice but it takes too long to be worth it. It might be do-able with the API though (requires paying).
You should see his [exit interview](https://youtu.be/MlWB6Z4nHm0). Dude looks like he's bout to break down. I'll still root for him - in red &amp; black or not - but I ain't holding my breath.
You take that ticket off your flair RIGHT now. The ticket works with the Helix to guide red to victory! Not against him!
You take the red pill - you stay in Wonderland.
You talking about the red ones with the reflective stripe around the middle?
You think it takes more power to go slow than go fast? Electric engines don't exactly burn a lot of energy while idling at a red light.
You use really bad quality red wine :-) That's part of the recipe.
You want that to be the red mallard
You were the first red person on TheButton.
You will get red eyes either way
You'd think they'd consider this when choosing the colours... According to wikipedia 7-10% of all males are red-green colour blind. That's a sizable chunk of their development team!
You'll make right on red illegal. That would be a terrible idea!
You're correct BTW. I've just finished taking my in-class sessions at a driving school (in Toronto) and they kept emphasizing to keep a proper distance from a vehicle or else I'd be charged for following too closely. The only way the other vehicle can be charged from being rear-ended is if they are at an intersection at a red-light and they were found over the white-line before the incident; if a vehicle rear-ends them then they may be pushed further into the intersection causing more problems.
You're from Texas but you prefer that communist red soda instead of good ol red white and blue Pepsi? You should be ashamed of yourself.
You're gonna get the red circlers out of a job!
You're missing blue-red...
You're not confused. You've just been missing out on the ~~baby mama~~ [red flair drama](http://www.reddit.com/r/thebutton/comments/330bur/button_update_issue_resolved/cqgbgvr) we've been having over the past day and a half.
You're saying seriously that that's a red flag that she might see in you?
You're taking too much. You really need a digital scale to make sure you're not taking too much. It's especially easy to get nauseous if you take too much of a red strain.
You're the red mallard aren't you?
You've been given so many red flags and so many massive pieces of proof and you're still coming here for reassurance? You need to think rationally. He's lying. He's always been lying and you need to sort it out. What else has he lied about?
You've got red on you.
You've probably met a lot of them and never realized it. I don't go around telling everyone I meet that I'm red/green colorblind.
YouTube red isn't available here
Young should have as well. Both teams have gotten off from red cards.
Your circle makes her look like she has a big red mustache.
Your comment doesn't have a downvote so now you are continuing to be a moron. Proceed with your continuation of red herring and I might give you a downvote.
Your face is red?
Your feelies are hurties because you transphobia is showing? Well have fun washing your hands of all the red :*
Your girls coat is so pretty! Is that some sort of red dapple or something?
Your health bar is just how red your screen is. Duck behind cover and regenerate.
Your milk ain’t fresh enough if there ain’t a lil red in it
Your red and green for the bar on the bottom is hard to see if red-green color blind. I'd recommend adjusting those colors some.
Your school got red dawned?
Your son runs red and black? [[Damnation]] is some good hate there.  It will kill every creature in play.
Your username looks like you were trying to strafe shoot in CSGO while inspecting your red line.
Yup. Gotta know your area. Md has not gone red for a president since the year I was born.
Yup. I'm red green colorblind so I know I do
Yup. That's me. Nobody knows the road rules when the traffic lights go out. I can't even begin to comprehend how dangerous it would be. I'd rather sit at a red light than risk some retard flying through and t-boning me

Taste is the signal coming from the tongue and flavor is the combination of your senses. The professor did do a test where he blindfolded people and put a clip on their nose so they only experience the taste of skittles. The results were the same as guessing though the professor admitted that the distinction between them might just be very subtle without smell.

[Here](https://linustechtips.com/main/topic/999916-solved-red-cpu-led-on-motherboard-pc-worked-fine-yesterday/) is a forum thread talking about one red CPU_LED situation. 4-pin instead of 8-pin could be part of the problem but it's unclear. Usually some plug with 4 pins is intended for a socket with 4 holes so if you didn't follow the specifications / directions that might've led to pins carrying higher voltage being connected to circuits that can't handle that level of power.

[I just posted about this below](https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfAwarewolves/comments/jah8ou/z/g8qcm1w). But 538 disagrees with you. They had calculated an EC advantage for the Democrats as recently as 2012. If that election had been even in popular vote margin Obama would have been the favorite. It tends to flip flop around more than most think. I think what it takes at the moment is a slight blue lean in a few heavy EC states while most of the red states stay heavily red.

and red zone turnovers. better discipline and if we did the insane of just attempting a FG every time we got to the red zone and we are at least a 4 win team. not even exaggerating. the red zone turnovers cost us at least 2 or 3 wins by themselves.
and there's also green shells and red shells

bit late to the party but I’ll jump on the bandwagon anyway... My parents would tell me never to touch red stones because they were super sharp. I just kinda assumed that they had paper thin but razor sharp spikes on them that would cut you. It made sense to me because blood is red. only figured out aged 13 when I fell and landed on one and I didn’t cut myself. Despite that I still am always more cautious around red stones over any other colour of stone.

if the su-35 is chasing down another plane it can help it put it's target on the nose quicker so it can shoot. Also losing speed can be advantageous if the su-35 is going to overshoot. If the su-35 got into a [scissors](http://www.simhq.com/_air/images/air_040a_6.gif) with another plane without vectoring it would definitely have the advantage as it would be able to turn harder and slow down much quicker and still maintain control. No planes with vectoring have ever engaged against other planes in real combat afaik so people aren't sure if there are any real defensive advantages to vectoring. Like you said it often slows the plane down which is really bad for defence. Source: some guy talking about vectoring in the f-22 vs sukhois after a red flag event.

its more of a red on green issue. the red flower is blended in with the green of the plant.
its probably bright red because it wouldn't attract attention any other way
its really easy to just give a little wave whenever i notice someone parting like the red sea. Especially if they're on the left cuz clutch hand.
its red in game. Presumably the screenshot is from an earlier version of the map
its upside down!!! polish flag is red on the bottom!!!

lmao sorry I'm just trying to find out what color my flair is. Is it red or brown?
lmao whats up dog i have the same airflo rail in red
lol are you really getting your panties in a twist because you can't run red lights without consequence?
lol im only in my 20s. Doesnt look amazing but I figured that's because it was in plain bright red.
lol why would you paint that red? to highlight a useless door?
lol yeah remember red alert .ini's modifications :D I had 2 or 3 ones that I switched before playing :P I remember my grenadiers that was launching 3 V2 missile per secondes and was regenerating life(like mamouths) and my flame troupers using tesla electric arcs (dunno why after some steps some of them was stuck. So that was somethink like a mobile tesla coil that could stop moving at any time and become a turet)
look it up. red mines pierce immunity.

man you are living in some weird fantasy...osu had some really weird playcalling in the beginning which caused them to settle for field goals in the red zone...it should have been 21-14 instead of 21-6 when OSU started to mount their comeback. they were up two TDs with a few mins left and had over 130 more yards than bama. Bama did not beat themselves...OSU beat Bama.
maybe becasue they are on the opposite end of the visible light spectrum. red beeing on the lower end of energy (even lower energy and it becomes infra red) and blue beeing on the top end of energy (even more energy and it becomes ultra violet).
maybe because red hair is very different from all the other natural hair colors
maybe he could be visiting red or something
maybe he's never had a red bike before?
maybe its because im colorblind but i dont see why becuase i have red-green colorblindness.
maybe times have changed but i parked when gates opened for red stage act Unknown Mortal Orchestra a few years back and walked right up to the rail.
me too but protanopia is red deficient and deuteranopia is green deficient. wouldn't it make sense to reduce green or red depending on which one you have?
me too! I’d love to see it with different color manes like red or even purple
me: \*has a litte color weakness (red/green)\* everyone: \*pointing at something obviously red/green\* what color is this?
mfw two comments later they think barely losing in a deep red state is proof you can't win
mmm...I worked hard to be the best team player I could be to get my red and green ribbons. Letting it be easier to get them would kinda slap us all who play earnestly in the face.

my only regret was not selling more CS skins to invest more in PUBG alpha items but i cant be upset with snagging a bandana for 35 and red hi-tops for 16.
nice double play! im liking the red hats with the blue uniforms too.
nice work! oh and btw can the highlight of child comment be a little bit pinkish red(to match it with Indonesian red theme) and to differentiate it with a comment highlight for the last time post visit(reddit gold perks)
no? He's using evidence based past AZ elections. It's a red state.
not for me. I'm colorblind. The red blood blends in with the dark body and the grass.
not if they're red
not if youre red-green colorblind :(
not red hair and not sfw. I'm going to unsub from this garbage. &amp;#x200B; Posted by LizzyBlakeOfficial. spammy look at my ass bullshit.
not too shabby my friend. backes went down hard in the first. got walked down the tunnel. marchand got another goal. pasta followed up with a goal of his own. dobby let in a wrister from douggie (from teh red line) backes came back in the second and scored.  you are now up to speed.
objective red picks?
obviously they were playing red rover and this was steves plit to win. everyone stepped back and steve won something all right
oh it's red that's why i can't see it lol
oh man. that's awesome. this is something i was seriously worried about. i love to tank but i am red/green colorblind. thank you for pointing this out.
oh noes! A red suit!

one more question: which line is the large top-middle red text? I still can't find that one
only change once i clicked on it. Went from grey to dark red?
only if you wear a red sweater

really depends on your side. blue side it is way more cost effective for a pink because you put it in tri and it lasts for so long. red side river pink doesnt last nearly as long.

red/green/brown are pretty much the same to me The consensus from /r/ColorBlind is that purple doesn't really exist anyway.

that one part of his house reminds me of the robocop scene where red foreman explodes that dude and also the drugging scene in big lebowski (article confirmed that one at least)
that sounds like phase issues with your speakers. Make sure that they are both wired with the same polarity. Quick check is to just swap red and black leads at the speaker end (of just one speaker) and see if the 'hole' is gone.
that's a pretty sweet deal what's the difference between the armor msi card and the normal red gaming msi rx 480 is it just branding? Also whats the difference between the ssd you put in your list and the one I listed. They're both mx300s but is one faster?
thats what im doing. i went right near the letter e still doesnt pop up. its near the red car and the lamp
thats why theres a red underglow to the 'Ancient Knights' text
the deck that made it is called mono red devotion. just because it's being played in less numbers in this particular tournament doesn't make it NOT an archetype.
the flag of france... it has never been like that at one point in the beginning of the revolution the blue and red of the actual flag were reversed but the white was alway's in the middle. and the previous flage of france was a plane white rectangle during the restauration (after the 100days)
the joke is that hes been cooking the red-stone instead of mining it properly
the official wallpapers which were released not so long ago painted the Atlus as a shiny space station. Like the red glow was a reflection off a sun or something. this makes me theorise that the pulsing left side of the pulse which you see in the link you provided above to be a pulsing star maybe about to go supernova or something. pulsing stars confirmed?
the plort thickens. though in the jade maya video he says the date sep 27 1964 is a spider. but in the next shot he says he's a turtle. so probably a red herring

the solid evidence for red is the css that people have gone through
the trigger only happening when you surge it is really going to hold this card back. red doesn't have great ways to draw cards and it's gonna feel pretty bad holding this in your hand waiting to draw another cheap spell to play. The original bushwhacker is definitely much better in most circumstances but this will definitely see play.

there only 3 colours: Blue red and yellow? &amp;nbsp; I think Discord needs a colourblind option :(
there's the red/blue/green checkered ones. You have them by default.
they become red in the ult regardless of highlight
they could also be referring to cases of color blind which are more severe than (i presume) our red-green color blindness. I'm red green color blind and i also see the eye in the image. Some people see purple as yellow. Imagine that.
this is gonna suck! I didnt mind the colour scheme atm but now im gonna be looking all red :( I think a nice message to the titanfall guys on twitter. Might do something :)
this is very much overexaggerated. im severely red green colorblind and #1 and #2 look very different. this is a cool idea but its not accurate
this is what it's usually like at this time. Last year it was birthing pod decks and delver. the year before it was splinter twin and mono red.
this key is completely useless to red green colorblind people. high and low are nearly identical. and whose idea was it to have the lightest colors be the middle??
this live album is great. a must have for every collection IMO. im not even a huge VU or lou red fan but this one is fantastic.
this really red my dit
this whole sequence is cringey. now theyre walking in on a red carpet with girls swinging their flag on the side lol. now theres a guy set to play some shredding guitar it looks like. i love the rise of esports but this part of it can go away
this works a lot in my red deck. i hover over my land that can pump creatures +1/+0 and then hit em with the ole cleave. and it's obvious they aren't accounting for cleave based on their blocks being specifically only good vs the land pump.
those are issues with programming. red cards are a rule of football. you have to follow the rules.
those red leaves are just 🤤
thoughts on an AK (red laminate to be specific) with howling dawn in the front position? managed to get one for market price about a year ago.

true. The Aldosivi - Lanus game seemed like they were fighting for something. Lots of yellow cards and one red. How do you think Banfield &amp; Racing Club's positions play a role? I'm not really good at this Argentine league but i would expect more open games since its towards the end of their season.
try doing a hard restart basically holding the button till it turns off then wait for the cord light to turn red then unplug for like 5 min then plug it back in
try mentally aligning the red
try out the [enchroma test](http://enchroma.com/test/instructions/). They will try to sell you glasses but I narrowed down my colorblindness to moderate red deficiency.  Theres a bunch of good info over at /r/ColorBlind
u/cpalone for example this red is damn near impossible for me to see. I had to fuck with my color settings on my phone. For a dark background like this a lighter contrasted color would work best.
unless you're colorblind so red and green are indistinguishable

we are very POGCHAMP jokes aside thank you for your comment it was intersting. so do you have like your yellow and red cone missing or are they just really damaged ? and is your blue on damaged ?
we eyes are insanely red here looks like she just got done chiefing on a joint
we have a lot of the same associations! 5 is definitely proud. self involved too thus the bold red color. 4 is 5s best friend and kind of henchmen. I can only describe it as the best friend figure in a movie. 1&amp;2 and 8&amp;9 (1 and 9 are dominant) 9 is a bitch though
we were riding plenty of desserts in red dead redemption but it was still an awesome experience!

well if you want some headphones with red lights check out the Lenovo Y Gaming headphones
well its not always juniper. there is the pacific red cedar http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thuja_plicata
well the literal interpretation is we put a glass cage (a greenhouse) around the whitehouse (where the president lives) and apparently there's a nursery that's painted red.
well yea and neither did athens...but columbus and athens arent right up on the Lake. columbus and cleveland will never go red.

when i was a kid there was these abandoned buildings up in the mountains that i liked to go mess around at they were damaged during the loma prieta earthquake tons of rubble and garbage strewn all over the place over the years one thing i remember is that all the paint was peeling off of the buildings and there was a deep red color from the metal beneath there was one supportive post in particular which looked like it was made out of blood i think it was made of iron or something i'd never seen steel rust that much anyway i used to rub my hand on the post and then pat the dust on my shirt so that i'd have dark red handprints all over and then run around with a stick pretending to be an indian i'd do this for hours but i'd always leave before it got dark because it was kind of creepy up in those mountains and i needed enough time to ride home on my bike before it got dark i used to come home and my mom would scold me for getting my clothes dirty but not very much looking back now i'm pretty sure she worried about us running off to the mountains alone all the time but she held herself back so we could adventure and grow and i appreciate that she didn't coddle us anyway one time my dad came home early and he saw me in my dirty shirt for the first time and just looked at me and then looked at my mom and asked waht the heck was on my shirt and she told him it was rust and then he turned to me and asked what color it was (i'm colorblind and my dad likes to ask me about colors sometimes because he likes to tease me and stuff) and i didn't want to say a definite color because i could tell what he was up to so i decided to say something non-specific so he couldn't catch me and replied *oh it's post irony*
when you have protanomaly you can see every color the only thing that the glasses does is make you **distinguish** them i have protanomaly myself and can see every color. and no red and green arn't hard to distinguish since george doesn't have protanopia but protanomaly
where are the red
white ? black blue ? ? orange ? red ? purple  I'm learning Estonian so that helped me guess some of these
who says it is red besides some colorblind people and people with weird screens

why do some people have red names and stuff
why is William's pants red?

yea just went to check mine as well. red and missing those pages. bummer.
yea ok come find me when the playerbase declines because people cant get open a free crate for a red shirt and have to pay 4 cents on the market for it.
yeah I guess but the team's not *that* different from last year. How long could it possibly take to build chemistry. Also chemistry has nothing to do with missing penalties and collecting red cards
yeah i don't care about calibration since i'm slightly red/green colorblind
yeah i don't like the red either. is it possible to mod the case to make it rgb?
yeah im same with red green doesnt effect me that much seen as he doesnt use too much red in his paintings (well from what i can see seen as red is pretty much invisible around green) but thats one of the things that im worried about when i get to painting is that ill mess up somewhere with the colours
yeah its a vveeerrryy long queue :/ I think Cannon Club is higher than red right?
yeah that isn’t good... red vs. blue happens the most though
yeah they usually have red as prototypes so this guy may have one of very few prototype helmets that cost a ton
yeap and at one point I saw a red outline in the outermost box but when I aligned it it disappeared.
yee I can finally be Ranma all I wanted was a red alt for Ryu but Ken's gameplay looks cooler too
yeesh red huskies are way too cute.
you are focusing a lot of energy on trying to prove me wrong. tell you what. i will write you a check for $500 if wizards prints a mono-red creature that has an activated ability of drawing a card without discarding any cards.
you can from the multitools in the red box. not the noc given ones though sadly
you can in a red jersey
you can not say gen 1 is the best unless you are a yellow fanboy beause fire red and leaf green are better remakes with the same fighting and story so gen 1 is not the best to any sane person apart from yellow fanboys
you can transfert from fire red to diamond. I think you need the poketranfer app on your 2ds to be able to transfer from diamond to the pokemon bank app and then from pokemon bank app you can tranfer to sun moin (but only in january when the bank will update).
you can't really do anything against a red shell though. or are the green ones the ones that follow you..?
you forgot the firefox or red panda http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_panda - so cute. Want it!
you gotta part that shit like the red sea and get to the goods in the middle
you havent watched kizer in the red zone this year. nothing is guaranteed.
you like red ? name every communist leader
you need to wear a red lipstick. all week. on your lips and on your nipples too.
you sure its deuteranopia and not protanopia? just asking seen as a red green colour blind person sees netherite really well seen as its a much darker colour than netherrack
you will have no issues with a red and purple fire fish in the same tank.
yours shows straight red/blue. mine shows degrees of red/blue. the lakefront is basically blue or damn close to 50/50. you can zoom in.

🇺🇸 also contains red 🤔🤔🤔
"“First things first,” Toby Mitchell stated, putting up his hands to the press mob gathered at the foot of the dais, flashing a salesman's smile, “we're not here to discuss last quarter's model.” He was dressed in what had become his trademark; a slightly rumpled Tartan button-up sweater with the sleeves rolled up, just as rumpled white collared shirt beneath it, black pressed slacks and red high tops, topped off with wire-frame specs, wireless headset in his ear. It had become the epitome of what it meant to be successful in the new high tech world; enough knowledge to understand that your image defines your character, with enough disdain to keep the young demographic on your side. “We're here to show you the next generation of Iconic technology.” He pushed the bridge of his frames back up his nose with his middle finger. It didn't matter that the lenses corrected for nothing, it was all about the image. The arty Bohemian with technical chops, the suave businessman that hasn't lost touch with his creative side, engineering meets art, yin and yang, light and dark, a mechanical heart covered up with so much glamour you barely remember it's a machine. “What is it this time, Toby?” Martin Chun, the critic from the New Yorker piped in, “A larger version of your last virtual phone? A new costume on the same old song and dance?” The sharks gave a soft chuckle on the barb. The virtual phone had been a bust, but was necessary to keep pace in the mobile market. Martin had published a stinging review that set the rest of the media against Iconic. The PR damage control had cost him more than a few nights' sleep and even more PR reps their jobs. *Oh Marty*, Toby thought, *I'd love to see how you're going to try and eviscerate me for this.* He gave another smirk to the conference room, turning so that all the cameras could see his positive reaction to it. “No, Marty, as I said, we're not here to talk about the past.” He clasped his hands in front of him and nodded his head forward. “We're here to talk about the future.” He looked into the teleprompter next to the camera to his left. “We live in an age where mobile computing and communication has become the norm. Gone are the days where you're locked to a desktop computer, or even a laptop to keep in contact. Landlines? A dinosaur of telephony that is only present in the most ancient of infrastructure. I mean, seriously? Who still has a handset in their homes? Or further, who has a phone that isn't connected to the Internet? Hands up! C'mon! Anyone? Marty? I know you clung on to your flip phone to the bitter end...” Another muffled chuckle, this time not at his expense. He pulled a half-silver, half-black prism, 10cm by 10cm and 5mm thick from his jacket pocket. It projected a 3D image of itself in space, seemingly held up by rays of light. “The *Iconic* Virtua system, though a breakthrough in real-time design, teleconferencing and communication, is still not powerful enough to keep up with the demands of industry and the public.” The image flipped between each of its most useful facets before turning off. Toby flipped it in the air, caught it with a quick swipe and pocketed it with a slight frown. “It did not move at the speed of life.” He moved back behind the dais, clenching the sides, his frown turned into a disappointed grimace. “So,” he quickly slapped the lectern, “where do we go from here?” He began to pace back and forth across the stage, his audience following his path. “Accept defeat? Go the way of the Blackberry and the Palm Pilot? Become another clone in a world of knock-offs and wannabes? Go back to the tech wars of Apple and Android with similar yet equally disappointing products?” He scoffed and returned to his place center stage. “That would be what other companies would do. What are we going to do? Well, we'll do something,” he let his pause grow pregnant before cocking his head and smirking, “*Iconic.*” “With that, I want to open the floor to questions.” The press began to rabble, eager to get the first scoop. *They don't even know what they're reporting on and they're already scrambling for more.* “Ah ah ah! Not so fast. The questions have to have an already solved answer. Trivia, if you will. Something that you can verify, right here, right now.” The silence grew for a few moments before Sylvia Romero chimed in from the back. “What was the first personal computer?” “Programma 101, 1962. Next?” “Who was the man who invented the radio?” “Gugliemo Marconi. Come on, guys... technology is my bread and butter. Give me something hard!” Toby could see the nerves run through the room. A bunch of technology reporters and critics (mixed with a couple tabloid hounds) trying to come up with questions out of their element wasn't their cup of tea. One could see screens lighting up as they searched for questions to ask. “When was Constantinople renamed to Istanbul?” “1930.” “Who did it?” “Well, Sultan Mehmed the Second named the city, but you could debate that it was Mustafa Kemal when it was made official.” “What is an Elephantomyia pulchella?” “An extinct crane fly from Middle Eocene Europe. Please, stop going to Wikipedia for your questions, guys. Give me something difficult!” His grimace had slowly and smugly turned into a grin. This is fantastic! They're eating it up! “You've got to be cheating,” Marty spat from the back, “You've been reading from teleprompters for your speech. You've probably got your Virtua listening from your pocket and feeding answers to your earpiece. You may have all of them fooled but you can't fool me. What are you trying to prove?” Toby raised an eyebrow and stepped out from behind the dais and jumped down to floor level. “Cheating, am I? Okay, let's play by your rules then.” He plucked the Virtua from his pocket and tossed it to Sylvia Romero. “I know you have one of these. Turn mine off, would you?” Shocked, Sylvia fumbled it in her hands and dropped it to the ground. “On second thought”, he said as she bent down to pick it up, he brought his heel down on the center of the device. With a crunch of glass and electrical components, the screen flashed once more and went dark for good. “Right, where were we,” he stated matter of factly as he locked eyes with Martin Chun, “ah, yes, my pocket spy is dead, I'm down on your level and you were about to expose me as a fraud, right, Marty? So, go ahead. Ask me a question. Anything. Because of anyone in this room, you are the one person I can count on to play me to my weaknesses. So,” Toby held his hands up in mock surrender, “finish me off.” The two locked eyes in silence for what seemed forever in context but was really only a few seconds. “What was my first published article about?” Martin gave a sly smirk. *What an egotistical prig.* “Well, that all depends.” Martin's grin grew at the balk. “Depends on what?” “On what you consider published. I could take your first article at the New Yorker on the decline and demise of the American electronic component market, or!” Toby stepped in close so only Martin could hear him whisper, “your hyper-sexualized article in the Heuristic Squelch on the merits of interracial dating in university under the pseudonym Wang Chun in your freshman year.” Toby stepped back to see the colour draw out of Marty's face and his jaw drop. Martin's phone rang in his pocket. He fumbled to silence it when Toby shouted, “Please answer it. In fact, put it on speaker!” Toby still had not broken eye contact. He stared down his startled nemesis and watched him clamor to save face. Martin swiped the screen and activated the speaker. “Hello?” “To answer your question, Martin,” Toby's voice called out of the phone to everyone's amazement, “is that I'm trying to prove that you were right.” Everyone now stood in shock as Toby firmly stood in the center of the room, without a device in his hands and without speaking, yet somehow carrying on his speech. “The Virtua is too slow. It was a, how did you put it, ham-fisted attempt at shock and awe marketing with all flash and no true advantage.” He turned and began walking to the stage. “That's why we dug deep and looked at the flaw in the system; having to interact with a separate device in the first place. Why does there have to be a delay between question and answer? Call and response? A possible loss in translation between collaborators?” He mounted the stage and turned to his enraptured audience. “You were so very close in getting to the root of it,” Toby pulled a cover away from his wireless headset, revealing a device that looked identical to an external hearing aid implant. “The answer is this. A direct cognitive link to the entire composition of human knowledge.” He resumed his typical salesman persona, along with the presenting hand motions. “Imagine being able to have an intimate conversation and not having to worry about someone listening at a doorway. Imagine researchers being able to share their findings instantly and simultaneously around the world with nothing lost in translation. Imagine never being at a loss for words in trying to describe your thoughts when you can literally share your thoughts. Welcome to the NeuralNet. Instant communication, direct access to information of all kinds, collaboration at the speed of thought! Everything your mobile computer can do, this does faster, leaner and more efficiently. If you had had one of these, Martin” he pointed to his ear, “I wouldn't have needed the theatrics of calling you like this, but one must bridge the gap to those with legacy equipment after all. I digress, I've gotten away from the question at hand. What am I trying to prove? I'm trying to prove that we are not your ho-hum, run of the mill mobile technology company. We are who we are, we are what we make, and make products that are...” He gave one more super-white grin and made sure to make eye contact with every reporter and look into every camera. “Iconic.”  Hello, my name is Yu Lijuan. Okay, that is not really enough about me to get the whole picture. As I write this, I am currently twenty-one years old and have been pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Law at CUPL. My parents are Ni Mei Ling and Yu Jian. They were both born in Beijing and grew up through the beginning of the end of China's one child policy. I was born April 4th, 2044 as the fourth child. Our family lived quite comfortably in the Chaoyang Park. Our family of six was large compared to tradition, but what can I say? My parents really loved each other back then. My siblings were all older than me and from what I can remember we were quite close. I cannot remember much about them, except for one date. November 5th, 2048. That day, as my mother and I were walking to pick them up from school, a bomb exploded at the front gate, collapsing the front half of the school and killing 200 students. All of my siblings were among them, my brothers Cheng and Honghui and my sister Fang. Mother and I were close enough to be hit by debris and the shock wave. Father was at work in the CBD but rushed to the hospital after learning where we were admitted. The blast perforated my ear drum and I have needed a hearing aid ever since. Needless to say, my parents did not send me back to that school the next year and I was sent to an international school. I had to explain to the teacher and other students that they would need to speak loudly to me for me to hear it, and they would always ask how it happened. After hearing about how I survived, the English kids would always say “Lucky you...”, which being Chinese and not having the best grasp of English at the time, I took as them not being able to say my name right. That is how I ended up with my nickname. That's right, in English, my name is now Lucky Yu. Even living in a progressive family in one of the most advanced cities and countries in the world, I'm what you might describe as a Luddite. Okay, that is not entirely accurate. I do not hate technology, but find that you can automate things too much. When I need to take a car, I would rather drive myself than have it do it automatically, and it has to be a manual transmission. My mobile phone hasn't been updated in years. I do not need to have the latest model in my hand or the newest gadget from the store. When I was eighteen, Iconic came out with their Neural device. I can see why everyone was excited about it. It completely revolutionized the market and how people interacted with information. It was brilliant! As a person who has already had to live with an electronic device permanently attached to my head, I was not keen on having a matching pair. On top of that, I wasn't comfortable with a wireless semi-biological computer using my skull as an antenna. But, as the new fad and the latest technology, everyone that was anyone was getting it. Can I blame them? No, it just wasn't for me. Looking back on what has happened, I still stand by my decision. I shudder at what mankind has done in the name of peace and 'progress'. I shouldn't be so cryptic, especially in my writing. It does one no good to know the conclusion without context, so let me start at the beginning..."
"####Old School House Party from Tampa, Florida. A camera pans across the crowd who cheer as House Party starts off it’s series of special shows. **Paisner:** Good evening everyone and welcome to an Old School House Party! I’m Allen Paisner. **Woodbridge:** And I’m Mark Woodbridge. **Paisner:** And boy, do we have a show for you! **Woodbridge:** That’s right, Allen. Tonight, we are following old school rules, which means.. **Paisner:** No top rope maneuvers, no closed fists and after every match we get to hear what competitors think as Derek Christian stands on the entranceway with a microphone. The camera cuts to Derek, who smiles there like the goof he is and waves his microphone in the air. **Woodbridge:** I feel bad for the competitors already. Anywho, let’s go to Javier and see what we start off with first. **Javier:** Ladies and gentlemen, the first contest for this evening is a singles match scheduled for one fall! **Crowd:** ONE FALL! **Javier:** With a 30 minute time limit! The match will follow Old School wrestling rules! Your referee for this bout is WiR Junior Junio Official, Ivan Itchicock! **Crowd:** Cock! Cock! Cock! **Javier:** Introducing first, already in the ring, from the shittiest bar in Philadelphia, weighting in at 300 pounds, the »Stink Fighter« DEWEY NEEDLER! **Crowd:** Yaaaaaaaaaaay! Dewey takes of his jacket with the words DEWEY NEDELER stitched onto it, and hands it to Maurice Chodon. **Javier:** And his opponent, hailing from Des Moines, Iowa, weighting in at 230 pounds, the »Collector« LOGAN LEE! Logan steps onto the ramp to a somewhat silent crowd, some boos can be heard. **Paisner:** No music tonight at least for some matches as this is Old School night. **Woodbridge:** And no crowd reaction either it seems. **Paisner:** Well we have a guy that hasn't achieved anything against a newcomer that only had a few matches in wrestling. The only thing he really did was to shit on some beloved old school performers. Logan climbs onto the apron and steps between the ropes, into the ring. He eyes Dewey in the opposite corner before taking off his jacket and t-shirt (coming soon to a website near you) and handing them over to Maurice Chodon who, promptly, leaves the ring. **DING DING DING**  **Paisner:** And the first match of the night is underway. Lee spits towards his opponent as the two of them start to circle one another. Dewey raises his stinking hand and offers it towards Lee as they first lock one and then the other hand.  **Woodbridge:** We have the 5'9, 300 pounder Needle against the newcomer that has a height advantage being 6'2 but is 70 pounds lighter. That could be a though obstacle to overcome for the newcomer. **Paisner:** You are really taking this Old school thing seriously aren't you? Dewey can't even throw a punch. While Logan Lee even as a newcomer is a highly touted prospect. Logan pushes the heavier man to his knees before delivering a knee strike into the abdomen of Needler. He pushes the head of his opponent towards the mat. Logan steps away and cockily taunts the crowd »This little sack of shit is mine!« to which the crowd responds with resounding boos. **Paisner:** The rookie talks a loud game for someone that is only a prospect. **Woodbridge:** The crowd doesn't care for Dewey but arrogant prick are a dime a dozen here. Dewey gets back up and rushes, his enormous girth forward, but Lee stops the rush with a vicious backhand chop to the torso of Needler. **Crowd:** Woooooooooooooooooooo! Needler stumbles back as Logan delivers another shot! **Crowd:** Woooooooooooooooooo! **Paisner:** Dewey in trouble early as the rookie proves why he is regarded as top prospect! **Woodbridge:** He is still a prick. Seriously, who doesn't like Andre the Huge! Dewey stumbles back after the second chop. He plants his foot and delivers a chop of his own! **Crowd:** YAY! **Crowd:** BOOO! **Crowd:** YAY! **Crowd:** BOOO! BOOO! BOOO! Dewey tries fighting back returning two shots but is again overpowered by the rookie. He stumbles back as Logan quickly advances and catches him with a closed fist punch straight to the jaw that sends Needler tumbling back. Itchicock jumps in front of Logan Lee, pushing the man back. **Itchicock:** First and final warning, old school rules, no closed fists! **Paisner:** It seems it slipped from the rookies mind! **Woodbridge:** Or he just took the chance and went with it! He has to be careful now, the next one is a DQ! Logan approaches his opponent as Dewey again raises his right hand offering a lock. The duo locks in, in the middle of the ring and the show of power starts. It almost seems like Dewey could get the upper hand but Logan, using his power, quickly turns the tide. He turns Needlers hand around and steps behind him applying the chicken wing lock! **Paisner:** Needler is in trouble! **Woodbridge** This could be enough! Dewey is clearly in pain as he tries to move towards the ropes but Logan holds him in place. He turns his head to the side, trying to escape the smell. He starts applying more and more pressure into the lock as Needler furiously tries to do something, stomping around in the ring center. **Crowd:** DEWEY! DEWEY! DEWEY! Dewey finds a new source of power as he leans backwards sending them both towards the ropes! Logan lets go of the hold before crashing into the ropes 300 pounds of man squishing him. Logan stumbles towards the corner as Dewey shakes his right hand. The larger man walks towards the Collector and grabs his hand, Irish whipping him into the ropes. He runs towards him and shoulder blocks him, sending him to the floor. **Paisner:** New life for the fat veteran! **Woodbridge:** Fat and smelly now I really know why Lee called him a sack of shit, it's spreading all the way to the announcers table! Needler picks Lee from the floor and tries to Irish whip him again but Logan stops the momentum with a vicious forearm shot to the face. **Woodbridge:** Itchicock talked about closed fists but nothing about forearms! Logan grabs the arm of his opponent and Irish whips him into the ropes. Needler bounces and comes rushing back towards Lee. Lee jumps up and catches his head under his armpit, driving Needlers face first into the mat with a jumping DDT. Logan goes for the pin: 1... 2... NO! Dewey kicks out at 2.5 to an incredulous Lee. Lee gets up to argue with the referee! **Crowd:** NEEDLER! NEEDLER! Dewey slowly tries to get up as Logan focuses his sights on his opponent again. He helps Needler back on his feet but Dewey turns the tables driving his hip into the stomach of an unexpecting Lee. He starts to throw slaps across the face of the Collector as the crowd backs the face. **Crowd:** Yay! **Crowd:** Yay! **Crowd:** Yay! **Crowd:** BOOOOOOOOO! Logan only grew angrier at the slaps and hit Dewey with a backhand slap across the face, diving his knuckles into the eyes of Needler! Needler stumbles forward rubbing his eyes as Logan grabs him again and sends him into the ropes. He lays out Needler with a spinning back fist sending him back down! Lee turns towards the crowd showing the Vulcan sign as the crowd showers him with loud boos. He grabs Needler for his greasy hair, picks him up and wristlocks his weakened right hand with his left. He pulls Dewey forward before turning around and hitting him with a rolling elbow! **Paisner:** The first time in the WiR! The [Shiny Raichu!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpMvPSX3lJA) **Woodbridge:** This should be it! 1... 2... 3… **DING DING DING** **Javier:** The time of the fall, 5:42, here is your winner, »The Collector« LOGAN LEE! Logan gets up as the crowd boos the winner. He rolls out of the ring and takes his shirt from the Chondon. There is a brief struggle as Lee rips Needlers jacket from the timekeeper, giving him a glare that makes the official sit down. **Crowd:** GIVE IT BACK! GIVE IT BACK! **Paisner:** A show of strength by the rookie. Inside the ring and outside of it too. It seems that the weight advantage didn't help Needler much. **Woodbridge:** Disrespecting an official! That's worse than murder! What is gonna do next? Kidnap me!? **Paisner:** Don't worry, I bet you are not in his plans… As of yet. But now we head to the entrance ramp with Derek Christian and the winner! **Christian:** Congratulations for your first win in the WiR even if it came after a shady backslap. How are you feeling after your win? **Logan Lee:** I haven't even broken a sweat I feel great! I said that I would win against that big pile of crap in the ring and I did. The first win of many and the start of a new story for me. **Christian:** You took the win and you also took Needlers jacket. Is this a statement of things to come for you? **Logan Lee:** It is a statement yes. It's a statement that no matter what you try to do against me I will beat you. I will make you submit and you will be just another piece of puzzle on my wall. I will take no prisoners and I will go above and beyond. And that is what this jacket will be. After I wash it that is. The first of many pieces to be placed onto the wall. The first piece that will tell my story. And I don't care if you don't like it. I don't care if the fans don't like it. It's about what I can do and what I will become in the WiR. You haven't seen the last of me. Logan stomps off as the crowd boos the winner. **Christian:** Those were the words of the winner. We’ll be right back. **COMMERCIAL** Backstage we see Logan Lee walking down a hallway before turning a corner and bumping into a hooded figure. **Hooded Figure:** So you remember the plan yeah? I go out there, chat shit. Then when I give the que you beat the shit out of him **Lee:** We’ve been over this time and time again. I’m not stupid, I know what to do. **HF:** Good, now I’ve put a lot of effort into this… OK, that’s a lie it’s gonna be easy. But don’t be afraid to follow in my footsteps and go overboard, break a few chairs maybe? **Lee:** Haha, maybe… maybe. Lee walks away holding two pieces of paper, one is a check, on the other the letters TD… **CAMERA CUTS TO THE ARENA** Javier stands in the center of the ring next to Tai Ni Wong. There is an old school feel in The Orpheum with several wrestlers already in the ring. **Javier:** The next contest is a tag team match scheduled for one fall with a 30 minute time limit! Your referee is Senior Official Tai Ni Wong! In the corner to my left, the team of THE SUPERSTAR and AKI MAN **Crowd:** BOOOOOOOOOOO! **Javier:** They will be taking on, at a combined weight of 467 pounds, KEVIN SCOTT JACKSON and MARK DUTCH! There is a mixed reaction of cheers and boos for the new team. Jackson pumps his arms to get crowd fired up and Dutch climbs on the turnbuckle and raises his arm. They aren't wearing their usual wrestling attire, but are in matching singlets. There are stripes of red, white, and blue on them, reminiscent of an older time. **Paisner:** This should be an interesting match. Mark Dutch and KSJ have never gotten along, but now they'll have to if they want a shot of winning tonight! **Woodbridge:** They're going have to learn to work together, especially if they want to be in the same movie. Let's face it, Dutch isn't likeable, KSJ is the real star but is being forced to make Dutch family friendly. Jackson steps through the ropes to get on the apron and The Superstar charges, kicking Jackson out of the ring. He immediately turns and clubs Dutch across the back, pulling him down and off the turnbuckle. **DING DING DING** **Paisner:** The Superstar with a cheap shot! This match is underway! The Superstar gives Dutch a hard chop across the chest, before sending him across the ring with an Irish whip. The Superstar sends Dutch down with a clothesline. He pulls Dutch up into a headlock. Dutch manages to slip out and hooks The Superstar's arm, going for a crossface chickenwing. **Paisner:** And here comes an early Snuggle Struggle from Dutch! The Superstar stops it by grabbing the rope! Wong calls for the break and Dutch cleanly releases the hold. He backs away and The Superstar charges. Dutch ducks the clothesline attempt and counters with a dropkick. He grabs The Superstar in a front facelock. The Superstar breaks away with an arm wrench, but Dutch is able to twist around and take The Superstar down to the mat with a double leg takedown. He pulls the Superstar arm back and holds him in a wristlock. **Woodbridge:** It's easy to forget that Dutch comes from a technical background. He's good with submissions, and he's also 237 pounds. It's scary. Jackson is back on the apron and yells for the tag. He shakes the tag rope like a madman , holding his hand out. Dutch walks The Superstar over to the corner and tags in KSJ. Jackson grabs The Superstar's wrist. **KSJ:** THANK YOU! **Dutch:** YOU'RE WELCOME! KSJ pulls The Superstar in and slams in the center of the ring with a snap suplex. The Superstar sits up and Jackson hits the ropes, kicking The Superstar in the chest. **Woodbridge:** And KSJ getting some payback from earlier! **Paisner:** This kid an an all star athlete! 230 pounds, amateur wrestling champion, and now he's a movie star! Kevin Scott Jackson has it all! The Superstar holds his chest in pain and gets to his feet. KSJ charges and knocks him back with a forearm smash. The Superstar staggers, and KSJ bounces off the ropes. He goes for another forearm, but The Superstar instinctively kicks his foot out. It catches KSJ in the stomach and gives The Superstar enough time to tag in AKI Man. AKI Man jumps in the ring and dives at KSJ's leg, knocking him down.  **Woodbridge:** KSJ is down, and AKI Man is locking on a surfboard! That's a painful move! KSJ is in a seated position as AKI Man puts his boot into Jackson's back. Jackson yells in pain as AKI Man pull his arms back. Dutch yells words of encouragement and looks concerned for his new tag partner. Jackson struggles and tries to fight back. He digs deep, using all the muscles he can. He gets his feet underneath him and is able to get to a knee. **Paisner:** There he goes! Jackson could honestly be the strongest person here, pound for pound! **Woodbridge:** Well, you know leverage plays a big part, and as an amateur wrestler, he knows where to place his hips. AKI Man looks scared as he loses his grip on KSJ. Jackson fights to his feet, feeling less pressure since AKI Man's foot isn't digging into his back. Jackson is able to twist his wrist and breaks free! He pulls in AKI Man and hits a [shoulder jawbreaker!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ddNAWtkCI) Jackson hits the mat, still a little sore from the surfboard. **Woodbridge:** A surprise move by KSJ! He has some big shoulders to make that move really effective! KSJ slowly gets up and makes the tag to Dutch just as AKI Man tags in The Superstar. The Superstar runs at Dutch, and Dutch charges back with a clothesline! Dutch bounces off the ropes and sends The Superstar down hard with a [spinning sit out neckbreaker slam!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAjGEkLZUfc) Dutch feels the roar of the crowd and pulls The Superstar up, sending him down with a sick DDT! Dutch goes for the pin! 1... KSJ sees AKI Man getting into the ring! Jackson climbs in as AKI Man launches himself over the top rope, looking for a cross body to break up the pin. KSJ runs over and catches him in midair! Dutch sees the commotion and gets up, breaking the count. KSJ uses his strength and is able to get AKI Man up, powerbombing him on top of The Superstar! **Crowd:** YAAAAAAAAAAAY! AKI Man rolls out of the ring as Dutch and Jackson high five each other. Dutch pulls The Superstar up enough to get a hold of the arms. Jackson keeps an eye out for interference as Dutch locks in the Snuggle Struggle. **Crowd:** TAP! TAP! TAP! The Superstar makes a weird noise and taps the mat. **DING DING DING** **Javier:** Your winners by submission, at a time of 6:46, KEVIN SCOTT JACKSON and MARK DUTCH! **Crowd:** YAAAAAAAAAAAY! Dutch and Jackson celebrate as Wong raises their arms in victory. The two wrestlers look at each other and Dutch sticks out his hand. **Woodbridge:** Don't it it, Kevin! You don't know where that hand has been! This never works out! IT'S A TRAP! Jackson looks around, seemingly asking the crowd what he should do. Dutch smiles, gesturing to his hand. Jackson nods and he grabs Dutch's hand, pulling him in for a hug. **Paisner:** They must finally trust each other. These two men have been rivals more than they've been friends, but will they tear up the tag division? Jackson and Dutch climb out of the ring and they walk up the ramp. They are met by interviewer Derek Christian. **Derek:** Awesome job out there tonight. How do you feel winning your first match together has a team? **KSJ:** It feels great, Derek! I'll be honest, at first I was skeptical about this partnership. We've never gotten along, but it's easy to see how much of a professional Mark is. I think he's changed, so this team should have a great future. **Derek:** Are you making a run at the WiR Tag Team Championships? **Dutch:** Isn't that the goal? To be the best? We are the best team here, we have a team consisting of nothing but future legends. In one corner we have the medalist Kevin Scott Jackson and by the ropes on the apon we have the Mass Eliminator Mark Dutch, dammit! we are the best wrestlers, and we are the best actors as well! **Derek:** Thank you so much for your time. **Dutch:** And one more thing, Derek, the money I'm making from this movie, I'm donating it to Alice, and I'm sure I have some to buy the fans here a couple of hot dogs! So, Kevin, let's go get ourselves some MOTHERFUCKING HOTDOGS! Jackson and Dutch continue to celebrate as they walk to the back. **COMMERCIAL** After the commercial break, Romero and Mil are already in the ring. Javier gives a quick introduction. **Javier:** Ladies and gentlemen, this is a singles match set for one fall, with a time limit of 15 minutes! Introducing first, one half of the WiR Tag Team Champions, STEPHEN ROMERO! **Crowd:** YAY! **Javier:** And his opponent, accompanied to the ring by Jimmy Chonga Sr., MIL LEÓNES JR! **Crowd:** YAY! **Paisner:** An interesting matchup here given the rules of the night. Mil’s aerial attack is gonna be neutered for the most part. **Woodbridge:** Romero is definitely the favorite. Any other night it’d be a closer contest, but tonight is about the heavy hitters, not the high fliers. Javier exits the ring, and the bell rings. **DING DING DING!** Mil and Romero circle each other before locking up. Romero quickly takes the advantage, pushing him into the ropes. Mil goes to hop off the top rope, but the ref stops him before he can. Romero takes advantage of the distraction, wrapping up Mil from behind and launching him across the ring with a german suplex, **Paisner:** And already Mil has received a warning from the ref, giving Romero the opportunity to go on the attack! Mil sits up against the bottom turnbuckle, and Romero starts to mudhole stomp into his chest. **Crowd:** 1! 2! 3! 4! 5! 6! 7! 8! 9! 10! YAY! Romero steps back, raising his arms in a Randy Orton style pose before running towards the corner to kick Mil’s head off. Just before Romero connects, Mil slides out from under him and gets to his feet, hitting Romero with a step up enziguri as he turns around. Romero falls to the ground with a thud, and Mil pumps his fists, hopping to the top turnbuckle. Just as he stands up, the ref stands between him and Romero and begins to count, to the disappointment of the crowd **Crowd:** BOOO! LET HIM JUMP! **Paisner:** Obviously this crowd wanted to see the high flying talent of Mil. **Woodbridge:** He's a gifted athlete Pais. This is like banning the dunk at Michael Jordan's prime! Mil shakes his head, getting down with a audible groan. He walks to Romero, who sends him to a knee with a quick kick. **Paisner:** And again the Ref unintentionally cause Romero stands up, grabbing Mil’s arm and pulling him to his feet. **Woodbridge:** Looks like Mil is about to eat some tricep meat! Romero pulls Mil towards him, swinging his arm out for a clothesline. Mil ducks, however, and rebounds off the ropes, jumping up into a tilt-a-whirl and landing into the lebell lock! **Paisner:** Rugido León! This could be the end right here! **Woodbridge:** He can't lock it in though! Romero is fighting to keep his head in the mat! Mil tries to pull Romero’s head up, and the crowd wills him on. **Crowd:** MIL! MIL! MIL! *Paisner:** Mil is fighting with everything he has, can he take down goliath?! Mil gives one last push and finally pulls Romero’s head off the mat enough to lock it in Romero wildly reaches for the ropes as the crowd goes crazy. **Crowd:** YAYYY! **Paisner:** The hold is locked in! Romero has nowhere to go! **Woodbridge:** He needs to use that giant reach to get to the ropes! Mil wrenches Romero’s head back, and after a moment of last ditch reaching, Romero is able to just barely get his fingers on the bottom rope **Paisner:** He *just* manages to grab the rope! **Woodbridge:** That could've been Mil's last chance! Mil breaks the hold and crawls back, pounding the mat in frustration. As Mil goes back to Romero, he pops up and grabs Mil around the waist, lifting him up and slamming him into the mat with a belly to belly suplex. **Paisner:** Belly to Belly! Romero takes advantage! Romero stands up, making a gun with his fingers and pointing to the crowd, who cheers in response. He slowly points at Mil and pretends to shoot the “gun”, grabbing Mil and pulling him to the center of the ring, signaling for the Street Crash **Woodbridge:** Street Crash time! This could be it for Mil! **Crowd:** Romero's gonna kill you! Romero's gonna kill you! Romero lifts him up, but as he finishes marching around the ring, Mil is able to counter with a last ditch frankensteiner! **Crowd:** YAY! **Paisner:** Mil won't stay down! Just when it looked over, he slips out again! Romero crumples on the mat, and Mil hastily gets up. He looks at the corner, then at Jimmy Sr., who grabs the middle rope and shakes it **Senior:** Use the middle rope! There's no rule against it! Mil quickly bounds to the corner, climbing to the middle rope **Woodbridge:** Mil is using a loophole here! There isn't much you can do from the middle rope though, so he must have something up his sleeve! Mil stands on the middle rope for a moment, looking at the ref, who simply watches and allows him to continue. He turns his back to the ring, takes a leap, and flips, hitting a Phoenix Splash! **Crowd:** YAY! **Paisner:** Holy Shit! A middle rope Phoenix Splash! Mil is pulling out all the stops to win! Mil hooks the leg of Romero, and the ref starts the count **1!** **2!** **3!** **DING DING DING!** **Javier:** The winner of this match, at a time of 6:24, MIL LEÓNES JR! **Crowd:** YAY!! Derek Christensen enters the ring, as well as Jimmy Chonga Sr. **Christensen:** Mil, you have just won your debut match against one half of the tag team champions, Stephen Romero! How do you feel? **Mil:** Great! This is big win! I am honored to fight! **Christiansen:** Jimmy, it appears you've taken Mil under you and your son's wing. Is this leading to reclaiming the titles? **Senior:** Nothing is for sure… I'm just proud if Mil for taking the opportunity and seizing the victory. **COMMERCIAL** *Dalidus Nova and James Ivory are seen backstage at House Party, sipping on [Smart Water] (http://www.dietspotlight.com/wp-content/uploads/smart-water-product-image.jpg) and discussing business. We see Moxie Moon come into the shot, glaring at James before talking to both men.* **Moxie:** So boys, I've thought about your requests long and hard over the past few days. **Dalidus:** Is that why we're not on the card this week? You spend so much time thinking that you forget to book us? **Moxie:** No, you weren't booked as punishment for blackmailing me. But trust me Dalidus, it'll all be worth it soon enough. *Moxie attempts to finish her statement, but is quickly cut off by a loud James Ivory.* **James:** EXCUSE ME. Did you just tell us that you were punishing us? Well Moxie, that comes under direct violation of the WiR Managerial Guidelines. *James pulls a large document out of a [neat and tidy portfolio] (https://www.atam.co.uk/media/catalog/product/9/4/9420099.jpg)* **Moxie:** James... how did you find out about this? No one else knows about theses, not even our investors. We're you snooping in my office? **James:** Well Moxie, if you read your own guidelines, you would know that you don't have an office. See here, page 8, line 13. It says, and I quote: ""employee's of Wrestling Is Reddit™ may not own or claim any rights to land or area in a Wrestling Is Reddit owned or rented. *James is about to pull out yet another document, before his portfolio is snatched from his hands by Moxie.* **Moxie:** Alright James, enough of your legal bullshit, I've heard enough. Look... You said you wanted a match next week, right? **Dalidus:** WE want a match. Look Moxie, if you have us under contract, you may as well use us on shows! I've always wanted to be here Moxie, and after A Happening, now is my time to claim my stake here in WiR. And with James under my training, we can bring great things! Think of the ratings, the attendance, all of it! But Moxie, it all depends on you and your booking. So, what do you have in mind? **Moxie:** Next week, it will be a Tag-Team match. You two, versus an unnamed opponent. You've got one week to prepare and find a team name. Good Luck. **COMMERCIAL**  **Javier:** The following contest is scheduled for one fall! Your referee is WiR Junior Junior Junior Official, Mia So Hung! Introducing first, representing the Lion’s Pit Fight Academy, from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, weighing in at 215 lbs, “DANGER” RUSS REYNOLDS! [The opening chord of Rainbow in the Dark by Dio rings out through the crowd.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcWKZTI9OC4) The curtains part and the crowd cheers as Russ Reynolds enters, trading in his usual ring attire for a pair of black trunks with yellow stripes down the side to match the kickpads, as well as a [black and white varsity](http://i.imgur.com/pQqmFCB.png). He walks to the ring, grabbing some high fives as he walks but keeping his eyes focused on the ground ahead of him. **Paisner:** Russ going for that classic hybrid fighting look from the 90s, trying to harness the no-nonsense fighters from the past, he promised to remind the world why he’s called Danger Russ tonight. **Woodbridge:** I mean shit, can you blame him? Guy’s had a hell of a few weeks. Going through hell in that steel cage match, having his livelihood bought out by some shitstain from Korea, I’m shocked he even made it in tonight! I’d be home drinking my brains out if I was him! **Paisner:** But of course, we’re lucky enough to have you here, drinking your brains out on TV. **Woodbridge:** I’m a professional! Russ goes to his corner, crouching down and stretching out on the ropes. **Javier:** And his opponent, from Woodstock, Ontario, Canada, weighing in at 232 pounds, JOEY MCCARTY! [Bleed and Blister](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrCP1LwpoGA) plays as Joey steps out and bounces on the top of the ramp. He olds a brown burlap sack over his shoulder, and hoists it in the air before runs down, to a chorus of boos from the crowd. **Woodbridge:** What’s in that bag! Is there a snake in that bag? I’m gonna lose it if there’s a snake in that bag. **Paisner:** Last week at A Happening, Joey had a great match with Dalidus Nova, and was on the edge of a huge victory, before Nova had to resort to an eye rake to break out of the Skate Bender. **Woodbridge:** Joey and Nova have been at each others throats for a while now, I’m not surprised in the least bit! Oh look, he’s about to ask us if he can be serious for a moment! Joey drops the burlap sack underneath the bottom turnbuckle in the corner, and snags the microphone from Javier. **McCarty:** Ladies and gentlemen, last week I promised you I would break Dalidus Nova’s ankle, but unfortunately, he decided that cheating was easier than losing and deprived me of sharing that moment with you. So since HE won’t apologize, on behalf of both of us, I’m truly sorry. But have no fear, this week I can guarantee that I’ll be breaking this turdmuffin’s ankle! **Crowd:** BOOOOOOOO **Woodbridge:** Mark, what’s a turdmuffin? **Paisner:** A truly deep question that will haunt us for the rest of our days, we just may never know. But what we will see if this focused Russ Reynolds is gonna be enough to make McCarty eat his words.  And our referee Mia So Hung calls for the bell! **DING DING DING** Joey charges straight at Russ, tying up with him in the corner, and peppering him with elbows to the head.  Russ manages to get a knee up, connecting with McCarty’s ribs, forcing him back. **Paisner:** Russ said he wanted a fight, looks like Joey’s gonna bring it to him! **Woodbridge:** We got an interesting matchup here, two guys who rely on submissions to put guys away. Joey’s probably gonna start targeting one of Russ’s legs to get him primed for the Skate Bender, while Russ heads uptown and is gonna try to loosen up Joey’s shoulders and neck for the Lion Trap. Gonna be a real test of who breaks first here. Russ allows Joey a moment to get back to his feet, shaking out his neck. They tie up in the center of the ring. Russ goes behind for a waistlock, Joey gets a standing switch and transitions it into a headlock, pushing his foot down on Russ’s calf, forcing him to the ground before releasing the hold and stomping on his ankle. **Woodbridge:** There’s that targeting! Right out of the gate and Joey’s thinking the endgame, that’s smart wrestling. Russ flips over onto his back into open guard, and taunts Joey. **Paisner:** Whoa, Russ is trying to invite McCarty into his guard, he wants to get right to the grappling, no messing around! **Woodbridge:** This could be that fire he was talking about before, that desire for pure competition. Reynolds wanted EVJ tonight, he wanted to wrestle clean, and by God he’s gonna wrestle clean! **CROWD:** WRESTLE, RUSS, WRESTLE! WRESTLE, RUSS, WRESTLE! Joey looks at Russ with his hands on his hips. He shrugs and drops down into Russ’s guard. Russ locks his legs around his waist in full guard, Joey stands up a bit and uses his leverage to push Russ onto his shoulders in a pin. 1… 2… NO! Russ leans up on a shoulder, stopping the count. He grabs on to one of Joey’s arms, hoists it behind his own back, and twists it into a double wrist lock! **Paisner:** Reynolds has full extension on McCarty’s arm! **Woodbridge:** This is his answer to Joey stomping on his ankle, almost saying that he can pick body parts apart too! Joey is able to grab his arm and pull it away from Russ, making it to his feet. Russ rolls back to get to a vertical base but is met with a running clothesline from Joey! Joey dives to make the cover, but Russ gets a foot up, catching him under the jaw on his way down! **Woodbridge:** Classic jiu-jitsu technique, kicking a guy in the head. Russ kips up and rolls through into a prawn hold on the downed Joey! 1! 2! No! Joey kicks out at two, rolling out of the ring. **Paisner:** Joey taking a quick breather, maybe didn’t know what to expect in this match. These two have only met once before in a six man tag. **Woodbridge:** Not the best atmosphere to scout an opponent in. But there’s one thing on my mind, what on Earth’s in that bag? I really hope it’s not a snake. **Paisner:** I don’t think Joey’s got an animal-handling license, so I hope not. **Woodbridge:** Oh, PLEASE. Because we’ve got such a reputation for following state legislation. Joey rolls back in, and is welcomed back in with a sudden Oklahoma roll from Russ! 1! 2! 3—NO! Joey kicks out, gets to his feet, and smacks Russ across the face! Russ is stunned for a moment, touching his cheek and leaps up to his feet, chopping Joey across the chest! Joey chops him back louder, and Russ grabs Joey and whips him into the ropes. Russ leapfrogs as Joey rebounds, Joey bounces off the ropes again and Russ bends over for a back body drop, and gets a kick to the chest from Joey for his troubles.  He gets a hold of Russ and lifts him up for a delayed vertical suplex! Joey slams Russ down and floats over for the pin! 1! 2! No! Russ kicks out, but Joey transitions to a grounded headlock, and wrenches it in tight. **Paisner:** McCarty’s gonna try to take the air out of Russ, make this as easy of a match as possible for himself. **Woodbridge:** The worst thing he can do is let Russ get momentum, when he gets going, he’s a hard guy to stop. Joey’s playing this REAL smart. **Crowd:** ASS-HOLE! ASS-HOLE! ASS-HOLE! **McCarty:** Watch your mouths! **Crowd:** BUTT-HOLE! BUTT-HOLE! BUTT-HOLE! **McCarty:** N-NO! Shut up! McCarty wrenches the headlock in even tighter, Mia asks Russ if he wants to quit, and Russ wags his finger no in the air defiantly. He gets a knee up! And then the other! Russ slowly starts makes his way off of the ground, but Joey is still hanging on! Russ pushes McCarty off into the corner, and marches to McCarty with purpose. **Woodbridge:** This is what Joey has worried about!  Russ is in control!  Russ starts lighting McCarty up with a flurry of open palm strikes to the head and chest! He follows it up with a huge gamengiri to McCarty’s head! McCarty flops face first to the mat and Russ follows him for the pin! **Paisner:** The Gladius Special! Is it enough?! 1! 2! 3—NO! **Paisner:** McCarty just barely is staying in this! That was a kick for the ages. **Woodbridge:** He’s a passive aggressive chump, but Joey McCarty’s got a hell of a chin on him. **Paisner:** Passive aggressive? **Woodbridge:** Well yeah, why else would he apologize for everything all the time? I wasn’t born yesterday, I don’t think he’s sincere with all of that. **Paisner:** Nothing gets past you, Mark. Russ stands McCarty up, and locks his hands around his waist from the front for a Northern Lights suplex! **Paisner:** He likes to follow this up with two more! He floats over and hoists McCarty up for the second Northern Lights suplex! **Woodbridge:** One more for the Aurora Borealis, named after the most complex word Russ Reynolds knows! Russ floats over and starts to get McCarty up for the last one, but McCarty is able to break the hold, kick Russ in the midsection, and catch him with a double underhook DDT! **Paisner:** Aurora Borealis broken up by the Five Minute Major! 1! 2! 3—No! Russ kicks out! Joey sits up in shock, and gingerly stands up, reaching for his back as he feels the effects of the two big suplexes. He grabs the now kneeling Russ’s head and starts raining elbows down from above! Mia admonishes him with a five count, and Joey breaks at 4.999. She forces Joey back to check on Russ, who is on weak legs. Russ turns to tell Mia that he’s okay to go on, and Joey goes for the Bertuzzi Punch, but Russ ducks it, slides through Joey’s legs, grabs his arm and tying him up for the [Rambo-Plex!](https://youtu.be/614dPDW-qFk?t=2) He hoists him up and dumps him over his head! He crawls over for the pin! 1! 2! No! But as Joey kicks out, Russ quickly transitions into the [Lion Trap!](https://youtu.be/KQP77HsNSE0?t=1) **Crowd:** TAP! TAP! TAP! TAP! Joey tries to lean back to take away Russ’s leverage, but Russ cranks it tighter! Joey’s face grimaces in agony, and he taps! The crowd erupts in cheers! **DING DING DING!** **Javier:** And your winner by submission at 10:39, “Danger” Russ Reynolds! Russ slides out of the ring to meet the crowd, slapping some hands as he rubs his head, recovering from the flurry of elbows while making his way to Derek Christian at the top of the ramp. **Derek Christian:** Russ Reynolds, a decisive victory to cap off what must have been a rough week for you, how do you feel? **Russ:** Derek, I’m a man of my word, I said I was gonna go in the ring today and get the job done, and that’s what I did. There’s a lot of stuff going on in my personal life right now, but I’m not gonna let it get to my head. I’m here in WiR to make a statement, and that statement is that Russ Reynolds is here for two things: to wrestle anybody and win titles! **Crowd:** WRESTLE, RUSS, WRESTLE! WRESTLE, RUSS, WRESTLE! The crowd is cut off by Joey McCarty, who has finagled his way into grabbing a mic. **McCarty:** Russ Reynolds, you should be thanking me! If I wanted to break your ankle, I could have at any point that I chose! But I decided to have mercy on you, because I realized that you and I are not in the same league. You’re okay, but I believe that I’m truly the new hot commodity of WiR. You wanna win titles? Fine. Go for it. But I’m above anything WiR has to offer. I’m championship material, but I deserve a championship that actually MEANS something.  A championship that’s worth holding! A championship that deserves to be defend justly as I see fit, and against all who wish to try their best at the nigh-impossible task of beating someone with a champion’s pedigree. Someone like me, for instance! And so… Joey walks over to the bag under the turnbuckle, opens it, and reveals a red and white championship belt, with the Canadian flag in the center. **McCarty:** Ladies and gentlemen, behold, your inaugural WiR Canadian Champion, Joey McCarty! **Woodbridge:** Oh Jesus. **Paisner:** It looks like we’ve got a new champ in town? **Crowd:** BUTT-HOLE! BUTT-HOLE! BUTT-HOLE! **Woodbridge:** Who’s gonna wanna win that thing? It may be worth going for just to shut Joey up, but who wants to go around calling themselves the Canadian Champion? **Paisner:** Well he said he was gonna defend it, so I guess we’ll find out in the next coming weeks! **COMMERCIAL**"

"#***NLTP: SECOND EDITION*** #**VOLUME 9: Boombox**  [BOOMBOX](http://i.imgur.com/VixChXZ.png) Key points to know on the map: * POWERUPSSS * Regrabs * When to get the bottom gate * Did I mention powerups? *The starters are a combination of total minutes played, and captain's ideas on who will start, so don't get mad at your captain if you aren't on here* Now let's get into the match-ups! *** #**RED DIVISION** *** **The Incrediballs vs. 21 Juke Street** **INC:** StufedBurger D, BlackHatGuy D, Pocketweed O, Cheetos O **21JS:** Snack D, UnoriginalSN D, jose_canseco O, thefatlace O, **Player to watch:** thefatalace **Commentary:** *Holy crap, this is going to be good! The incrediballs come into week 9 reeling after a sweep at the hands of the Make Ballives, whereas 21 Juke Street is thrilled to still have a shot at the playoffs. The task is simple for both teams. For 21 Juke Street- win both. For the Incrediballs- don't lose both. Look for thefatalace to dominate powerups and try to lead 21 Juke Street into the playoffs.* [Streamed by Nqoba](http://www.twitch.tv/nqoba) *** **Make Ballives vs. Operational Detachment Ballpha** **MB:** El Sacko D, RiverHorse D, BergierBerg O, Bonerfart O **ODB:** Makin Bacon D, pbzep68 D, Aerrow O, Bo O **Player to watch:** BergieBerg **Commentary:** *This match should determine loads of seeding in the open red division. For the Make Ballives, win both, and they've got the #1 seed, and a bye. For Operational Detachment Ballpha, things are slightly trickier. Their cap differential puts them in second, but with the other 3 teams challenging them for a bye playing the bottom three teams, they better hope for a sweep.* *** **Soviet Ballers vs. Ball Busters** **SB:** TurdFerguson D, Sewer Boy D, MoJoSto O, cran-apple O **BB:** TerraMaris D, Arisballtle D, Just the tip O, CocaCola O **Player to watch:** MoJoSto **Commentary:** *The Soviets went up against 21 Juke Street last week, and only came away with 3 points, effectively making their chances for a bye very slim. Their hopes need a lot of help, but there's still seeding left to play for. For the Ball Busters, their playoff hopes are gone, but there's still the chance to steal some wins, and create chaos. The stellar offense of the Soviets, led by MoJoSto will look to keep that chaos at bay.* *** **Nevermores vs. Jukeboxers** **NM:** Holdmaballs D, BC D, JuicyJuke O, Neka Lopta O **JB:** The Conch D, getcrossed D, boogy O, Apopalypse O **Player to watch:** BC **Commentary:** *Jukeboxers can put together a very good lineup, and shock some of the giants, as shown in last week's game one tie against Tag Reflex. It all depends on who shows up. They'll need their top players available to take down another top red division team, the nevermores. Nevermores are still looking for a bye, and they'll turn to BC for a strong defensive presence on boombox.* *** **Whose Flag is it anyway? vs. Tag Reflex** **WFIA:** LoweJ D, Knox D, Caduke O, Stromby O **TR:** foolwise D, Footba11Joe/wags D, Bongo O, CB13/Marquis O **Player to watch:** foolwise **Commentary:** *It's been a revolving door for Whose Flag is it anyway? this season, but if they bring a starting lineup into week 9, they might turn a few heads against a depleted Tag Reflex team. With many normal starters absent, their tie to the jukeboxers last week may have cost them a bye. However, both teams will go about business as usual, and look for some wins.* *** #**BLUE DIVISION** *** **Drift's Shitty Team vs. Unbelievaballs** **DST:** Ballymandias D, IrishBlizard D, Prizm O, ludifisk O **UNB:** Papi D, Peter Pan D, no name O, honeybear O **Player to watch:** no name **Commentary:** *The battle for a bye will be a good one. The rock-solid defense of Drift's Shitty Team, against the high-powered powerhouse of the Unbelievaballs, led by no name, coming off his week 8 10 O GASP. Ludifisk will attempt to match him on the other side of the map, with dazzling jukes and daring moves. This game will be one to keep an eye on.* *** **Saunuklear Bombs vs. Juking Under The Influence** **SB:** Frozty D, KennyPowers D, UberN00b O, justhavinfun O **JUI:** supermesh D, crawdad D, JukeKuechly O, Curl O **Player to watch:** JukeKuechly **Commentary:** *Juking Under The Influence looks for some momentum as they head into the playoffs, but they run into the Saunuklear Bombs just as they've been heating up. The Bombs have played their opponents tough the last few weeks, and this game will be no exception. JukeKuechly will look to light it up on offense, as JUI looks for some wins.* *** **Rectal Rangers 3D vs. Whitecaps** **RR3D:** ballparts D, jukeballhero D, Schweddys O, CPBear O. **WC:** SpongeBall D, red D, trendygrub O, A$AP Ferg O. **Player to watch:** SpongeBall **Commentary:** *Okay seriously Whitecaps, stop. They’re torn up every team in their path on both offense and defense, and it won't end here. SpongeBall comes in a week from his 10 D GASP, and the Rectal Rangers are struggling. The whitecaps look poised to roll into the playoffs, with 6 more points.* *** **Capybaras vs. Trippin Balls** **CPB:** lexanator5 D, FrankTheTank D, BIG Money O, ROJO O **TB:** Pyrrhus D, Anne Frank D, Ball Sac O, Skwid O **Player to watch:** lexanator5 **Commentary:** *This is actually a pretty interesting matchup. Trippin Balls just dropped two to liberty caps, ending dreams of playoff byes, while the capybaras' playoff hopes were crushed last week. Lexanator5 will lead the defense of the capybaras up against the offense of skwid and Ball Sac. A strong defensive presence can shut down offense, as lex will try to do.* *** **Capri Suns vs. Liberty Caps** **CS:** JAMES BUD D, Larcondos D, A-A-ron O, Air""M""Jordan O **LC:** Ludo D, Ashmungashma D, Meow :3 O, inFRAGilis O **Player to watch:** inFRAGilis **Commentary:** *Both teams are out of the playoffs, but that won't stop them from putting up a superb game. For the liberty caps, inFRAGilis will look to continue his team's winning streak, and stave off the strong capri sun defense of JAMES BUD and Larcondos.* ___ Somebody stream these games.

"* Mignolet, despite the new contract none of us are convinced he is a top keeper. Shaky kicking and a lack of dominance in his area made up for by excellent shot stopping * Moreno, not as much but his seeming inability to defend which costs us goals could come under scrutiny * Skrtel, for years he's been good but he gets bullied far to easy, and with Lovren's resurgence in form, Caulker in on loan and Matip apparently looming I can see Sakho's permanent CB partner being up for grabs. * Lucas, as much as we love him, Can seems to be number 1 deep lying mid, Lucas looks off the pace in Klopp's system * Allen, yet to make a himself a mainstay in the team. Injuries have held him back but with the depth of numbers we have in the middle of the park he might be surplus. * Milner, on big wages and hasn't been as good as many of us expected. If he isn't going to be a regular he has to be off imo, cant pay big for a bench warmer. * Benteke, obviously isn't working in Klopp's system. Has ability in a different system but it looks like we don't accommodate that and if he cant adapt I could see his career with us ending shortly. * Enrique, has a mountain to climb. Very unlikely he'll be a red at the start of the 16/17 season. * Sturridge, unlikely he'd be shipped off but if he cant stay fit can we afford him? We could use a fraction of his wages for a striker 90% as good whose fit consistently. * Lallana, in my mind he's not been worth what we payed. Once the injuries clear up I cant see him being ahead of Coutinho or Firmino in the squad, so unless we play all 3 he's a back up. I think I covered all the players who I think have something to prove. Ultimately everyone has to prove every day that they are capable of being a Liverpool player and that they're good enough to take us to the next level. Can't see Clyne, Skaho, Hendo, Can, Coutinho, Firmino, Ibe, Lovren being sold any time soon and some of the fringe player/frequently appearing youth players I didn't consider here. All just my opinion, disagree at will."

"**Barr** - Jason Taylor is a bit of a reach of projection, but the size/speed is there (and he looks quite a bit like him). I don't think his style will bring about a bunch of penalties. Meriweather is a bad football player who tries to compensate by huge hits with awful form. Barr is just an athletic monster whose hits are naturally thunderclaps. **Bridgewater** - Russel Wilson/Andrew Luck **Crichton** - Easily Jared Allen. Again, shooting high projection wise but when you consider how each of them are (or Allen at least was) good against the run and the pass, and their biggest asset is their motor. Not the most athletic guys, but great hand-fighters and their sheer determination drives their success. **McKinnon** - Would love for him to become a Sproles type guy, but the ""small RB = Sproles"" thing is used far too often and is more than often a bad comparison. He caught all of 10 balls last year. From the sound of things, he seems like a natural pass catcher which would definitely help. People also tend to forget that Sproles wasn't this shifty, 3rd down only RB in college, he had something like 850 rushing attempts. He was pretty much a workhorse. I see McKinnon (hopefully) being a healthy blend of between/outside the tackles running and 3rd down scat-back/slot duties. **Yankey** - Hard to really make a comparison with guards. I can't think of one off the top of my head. I believe that before the 2015 season he'll be starting. Could be this year, might be this next offseason. Johnson is the worse talent, IMHO, but he does have a large advantage in that he knows the (complex) blocking scheme. Yankey is extremely intelligent (enough to even play center), and might be able to pick up quickly, but we'll have to see. I would love to see him start over Johnson sooner rather than later. Not an athletic phenom, but the guy can haul gravel in the run game. I expect him to be an upgrade in the passing game, too. I'd say he's probably better than Johnson now, and certainly has much higher upside. **Exum** - Kam Chancellor. Not quite as abusive in hitting, but could be (/become) better in coverage. Definitely an SS but his experience as corner has me intrigued as to a combination of him (an SS who is pretty decent at coverage) and Smith (an FS who can lay the wood). Makes for a pretty decent comparison to Seattle's secondary. If you guys didn't know, he was rated, and considered to be BETTER than Kyle Fuller, the other VA Tech CB that the Bears took at #14. He had an injury-derailed 2013 season, but now that he's fully recovered I believe that he can be an absolute steal. **AC Leonard** - A personal favorite of mine, the dude is an athletic freak. I'd probably say that he reminds me of Vernon Davis (not as athletic as Davis, but you get the picture). Dude is very quick, is a natural pass catcher and is dangerous with YAC. Needs work on his routes and catching up to the level of competition. Has some off-field issues from what I've heard, but our locker room/coaching situation is quite equipped/ideal to handle that. Haven't done much scouting to talk about the late round CBs/DT, but I will say the last guy whom I'm EXTREMELY excited about is **Antonio ""Tiny"" Richardson**. The guy is a HUGE tackle with a great combination of talent and potential. Had some health concerns (knee, if I'm not mistaken) and needs some refining, but the guy has performed very well, and was considering a 2nd/3rd rounder at latest from what I had seen. Getting him in UDFA, even with red flags, is a massive steal."

Many thanks, as usual, to Hambone for letting me play in his sandbox. Enjoy.* --- “Christ, the road up here gets worse every year,” Leslie grumbled to herself, regarding the old logging road ahead. The area above Breitenbush Hot Springs was one of her favorites to go camping in this time of year, and she’d figured with the early warm onset of late spring/early summer that the snow would be melted enough to get her Jeep in. The snow was gone...but the road, if one wanted to call it that, was barely worthy of the name anymore and if anything, actually was worse than when she’d been up here two summers previously. Oh well. At least it kept the idiots in the city vehicles out, mostly. Her destination was a day-hike in from where she’d planned to leave her vehicle, up and over a ridgeline and down into an isolated bowl canyon that was home to a pair of really pretty little mountain lakes. Later in the year, she didn’t like coming up here all that much, because you never knew what kind of monster-truck-driving redneck assholes would come in and fuck with peoples’ cars just for the hell of it. The Forest Service guys did their best to get up here regularly, checking on the trailheads, stocking the lakes with fish if they needed it, and ensuring that wayward campers were minding the fire restrictions, but the truth was, it was a big place with a lot of territory to cover. Somebody could get lost up here for a lifetime. She engaged the 4WD, and slowly continued on. Boulders stuck out of the hard clay every which way in a haphazard 3d puzzle, and here and there trees had blown down during the winter, forcing her to be extra careful not to bottom out. Fortunately, her Jeep had enough clearance. She just had to take it easy. It had been a hell of a year. Discovering that her now-ex-husband had gotten into meth and had drained what savings she’d been able to muster had been an unpleasant shock. Learning about the multiple credit cards he’d taken out in his name, their names, and *her* name had infuriated her, and had started her down the path to divorce. His drug-infused reaction to getting served had required police involvement, and now he was in jail again for beating the living shit out of her. Not for the first time, she consciously chose not to think of it in *if I’d just seen it earlier* self-blaming terms, and focused again on the task at hand. An indignant jay screamed at her from overhead, as her whip CB antenna jogged a branch just below where he sat safely above. Amused, she flipped him a quick middle finger and continued on around a puddle that was almost certainly much deeper than it looked. Everywhere, there was an explosion of fresh spring growth, as though everything growing up this high had lost weeks and was making up for it. Presently, she came to one of her favorite spots, where the road in intersected the eastern end of Elk Lake, and she was free for the first time to stop and really enjoy the view. A break in the trees gave her an unimpeded look across the mass of tangled ancient driftwood that led out to open water. The lake sat in a mountaintop bowl, surrounded on north and west sides by ridges of the Cascade Range that stretched upwards into bony rocky fingers denuded of trees. To the south was a smaller, more rounded ridge heavily wooded by ancient trees, and Leslie knew if she hiked up that way she’d be looking back down on the Detroit Reservoir...assuming she wanted to see that, which she didn’t. The road led along the north side of the lake, garlanded on both sides in a tunnel of fir trees with wild tangled salmonberry thickets underneath. Here and there, small openings in the brush betrayed the presence of rabbits or other tunneling creatures who took refuge in its thorny protection. Leslie didn’t expect to see anything much moving. Her Jeep usually scared off the critters, although it certainly wasn’t as obnoxious as a lot of the 4WD vehicles one found in the woods. She cursed as one of her front tires caught a boulder she hadn’t seen and the Jeep bucked upwards suddenly. Eventually, her painstaking progress was rewarded with her intended parking spot, a sizeable meadow at the northwestern corner of the lake with a brisk stream of snowmelt burbling into the lake at one end. She parked, and got out to stretch. *It’s so quiet*. It really was. Only the sound of the wind, the chattering of birds, and the fading distant drone of a small airplane greeted her. She cocked an eye at the sky, considering briefly whether she wanted to set out on the trail now, or get an early start on it the next day. She had intended to get up here and just go, but it was already midday, which meant when she finally got where she was going, she’d probably be setting up camp in the dark... “Nah. Fuggit, I’ll camp here tonight. Not like I’m in any kind of fuckin’ hurry,” she finally muttered aloud. The matter settled, she moved her Jeep to the best campsite at the lake, just across the stream where it hit the lake, and set up camp. It didn’t take long. The campsite itself was already set up with a stash of wood, firepit, logs to sit on, well-combed flat spot for the light tent, which took all of a minute and a half to set up. Since she was hiking in, all of her stuff was of the ultra-light, highly efficient variety. Inside of ten minutes, she had things set to her satisfaction and sat down to think. *Fish. I want fish.* Suiting action to thought, she got out her rod and flies, taking her boots and socks off and wading into the shallows. The water, of course, was so cold, even in the shallows, that her feet were almost immediately numb. She dug her toes in, and cast out in the general direction of a deep spot protected by a boulder where it was likely there were fish lurking. Leslie had scarcely flicked her rod out for the third time when she got a hit. A good sized trout burst from the surface and lunged at her lure, grabbing it and immediately fighting the hook. It battled her hard all the way in, wriggling in the net and only subsiding when she put it down with a quick thrust of her belt knife. She regarded it for a moment, then turned and began wading back to shore. “Dang. I was gonna fish for longer. That was too quick!” She regarded the fish lying limply in the net. “You musta been eager to get eaten, huh?” She realized her mouth was already starting to water for the taste of freshly fried trout and made an executive decision to not wait for it. After all...this was *her* post-divorce celebration trip, not…. Her good mood suddenly evaporated as she reminded herself that she wasn’t here to think about Lugnut, and with some effort put him out of mind. She set her prize down in a flat spot on one of the handy logs and busied herself getting her hatchet out to split some kindling and get a fire going. She had a camp stove, of course...but one did not simply cook trout with propane when free firewood was at hand. Heresy. Besides, she wanted to conserve her fuel, and she had a feeling that having a fire *tomorrow* night might be much more difficult - the rangers didn’t stock firewood at campsites ten miles into the woods. She stacked up the kindling in a classic tent as her dad had showed her when she was little, stuck a burning bit of something into it, and before long, there was a merry crackling campfire popping away. Leslie watched it long enough to be sure it would self-sustain for a bit, banked a good-sized hunk of wood onto it, and then set about preparing her fish and getting the pan to cook it in ready. A little oil, some salt and pepper, a few herbs, and two well-cleaned fillets of rainbow trout later, everything sat sizzling in a pan over the fire, which by now had matured into a nice even heat. Leslie prodded at the fish with a fork, impatient for it to be done, and waiting to make sure it was done the way she wanted it. In what seemed like far too long, it was finally done, and she yanked it off the heat onto a waiting plate, nearly burning her lip as she scarfed it down without waiting for it to cool off. Fresh, hot, fried trout. *Yum.* “I think, if I could stay up here and never see another goddamn human being in my life, I’d be okay with that,” she said aloud, wiping her chin with her shirt and pulling a lock of her hair back out of her face that had gotten free of the hairband. Twenty feet away a crow sat on a stump, regarding the leftover fish and then her alternately with an expectant eye. She barked a laugh. The crow didn’t budge a bit. “You want some of my fish, huh? Greedy fucker. Go catch your own,” she told the crow, who only adjusted its feathers nonchalantly. Obviously, the thing had learned a thing or two about humans. Laughing again, she forked the last bit of the fish off her plate and flicked it towards the bird, who hopped down, grabbed the morsel and flew off without so much as a fare-thee-well. Shaking her head, she got her water pot out, filled it from the creek, and set it over the fire to heat. Dirty dishes were a good way to get other, less courteous visitors. While the water heated, she got out one of the few non-minimal camping supplies she had brought with her out of the Jeep...her prized camp chair. Logs to sit on were all very nice and everything, but they lacked a lot in lumbar support or the dignity she felt was clearly her due. Unfolding it and getting out a book, she settled in to spend the afternoon comfortably reading and drinking one of the beers she’d brought up on the off chance she’d have a chance to drink them. Her water was hot enough to wash with at about the same time her beer was done, and sighing, she set the book aside and got up to take care of business. Humming tunelessly as she scrubbed the plate and pan clean with camp soap and some sand, the hot water sloughed the mess off the aluminum and then she rinsed in the stream. “I think,” she thought out loud to whatever was listening, “the best thing about this place is no people. No phones, no radios, nobody bugging me to sign this or look at that.” She cracked open a second beer and regarded the lake. A breeze had kicked up a little while she’d been working, riffling the water and teasing at her hair. “Just me and whatever lives out here.” Overhead, an osprey circled silently, obviously with the same intention as she’d had earlier towards the fish in the lake. Grasshoppers in the meadow buzzed at one another. The silence was almost loud… “God, I’ve missed this.” She sat back in her chair, lifted her book again, and engrossed herself in *The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe*. Some time later, perhaps an hour or two, she belatedly realized that she hadn’t put out anything to repel bugs, scratching absently at a mosquito bite and grumbling to herself. Her friends had all had one recommendation on this score or another, suggesting “anything with DEET”, for the most part, but Leslie preferred her own solution and layered up with Avon’s ‘Skin So Soft’, which her own long-dead father and most of her male cousins she’d gone camping in the Midwest as a child with had always sworn by. It certainly seemed to do the trick. She tossed another log or two on her dwindling fire, let it burn up a little, and got out the marshmallows. Cutting a slender alder switch and trimming off the excess buds and limbs took only a moment. She stuck two marshmallows on it and held them over the fire, turning quickly to avoid any burning - her daughter, now 19 and both enrolled at and working at Oregon State University over the summer, had always liked them burnt on the outside, but Leslie considered that the very height of marshmallow heresy. She hummed to herself, getting them toasted *juuuust* right, and then pulled them off when they were a perfect golden-brown all the way ‘round, middles gooey and sticky. With the ease of long practice, she pulled them off with readied graham crackers and chocolate, and downed the s’more with relish. It was getting dark enough that she was having trouble reading, and she put her book back in her pack for the morrow. The hike would probably only actually take about four hours, tops, unless there had been some blowdown or a rock slide or something, although the snow had been melted long enough that one of the rangers had to have been up the trail far enough to check for anything like that. There should be signs at the trailhead if so. She gazed into the fire, watching the embers flicker like something breathing and alive. The sudden glimmer of headlights on the access road caught the corner of her eye, and she raised a hand to shade the light of the fire from her eyes as she looked. One vehicle. An SUV, unless she missed her guess, and giggled a little as the lights suddenly bounced when the driver hit a particularly large boulder. *Yup. That’s the Forest Service guy. He’s out late.* Perhaps ten minutes later, the crawling 4x4 made its way around to her end of the lake, and pulled up. The driver thoughtfully didn’t point his lights directly at her tent, which was nice, although she wasn’t sleeping. A door opened, and a man got out, walking over with a tired step. “Evening….oh, hey, Leslie. Haven’t seen you up here in a while,” came a male voice. “You’re up here kinda late, aren’t you, Hank?” she returned with a grin. “Decided I was gonna get a start on everybody else this year, while I could still have a fire.” Hank laughed, coming into the light from the fire. “Yeah. I figured there might be somebody up here with this weekend, and thought I’d take one last swing up this way on my way back down to the Detroit station.” He ran a practiced eye over her campsite. “I know I don’t have to tell you the rules on a campfire - no advisories yet, but just be sure it’s out all the way before you go in the morning, all right?” Leslie nodded. “You know I will. And you can say you went over them with me. We’ll call it good.” “Sounds like a plan. I’ll be up here again mid-morning, but I’m guessing you’ll be gone by then.” “Oh yeah. Gonna be up and on the trail at dawn - by mid-morning, I should be most of the way to Twin Lakes.” She nodded again. “If I still had any fish I’d offer you some, but I’m afraid I finished the one I caught off. And yes, I have a license, before you ask.” Hank chuckled again. “All right. I’ll probably see you when you come back down, then. Hike safe!” He turned and walked back to his still-running SUV, climbed in, and pulled back out, following the bumpy road back around the lake. Leslie sighed to herself as the last glimmer of his headlights disappeared at the other end of the lake. Now and again, she could still see the bounce upwards as Hank evidently hit a rock or something, illuminating the overhead trees, but even that was gone in a few short minutes. Her fire had started to dwindle to coals, and she looked upwards to the stars. The great shining pathway of the Milky Way shone brightly overhead, the moon not yet up to drown any of it out. In the woods, the occasional hoot of an owl and nighttime noises of animals echoed hauntingly. Happy, for what seemed like the first time in years, she retired to her tent and sleeping bag and laid on her back regarding the stars that seemed closer and more luminous than they usually were. A thought struck her, and she pulled a double-fist-sized bundle out of her pack. The Colt M1911 in its holster didn’t make a lump that was too big. She tucked it under her pillow, sighed again, and closed her eyes. --- Dawn came obnoxiously early. Leslie had, for once, fallen fast asleep and had stayed asleep the entire night. The immediate explosion of birdsong the *instant* that a distantly rising sun started illuminating the eastern mountains with a bit of pink was impossible to sleep through, and it only got worse as everyone in the woods woke up and apparently began yelling at one another to shut up. At least, that’s how it seemed. Not having a translator for ‘bird’, all she could do was assume, but it seemed like a safe assumption. Either they were yelling at each other to shut up, or they were trying to outdo one another to demand sex. She thought she remembered reading that somewhere. It was beautiful, but obnoxious. Leslie rolled out of the tent with a long-suffering groan, stood, and knuckled her back. “Fuuuuuuck. I’m sure not twenty anymore.” She stretched and was rewarded with a *pop* from something in her back that felt wonderful. “Ahhhh. Better. Lessee what we got for breakfast, here.” She dug around in the back of the Jeep and came up with a Powerbar, a bag of dried apricots, and a couple of GatorAde packets, one of which she dumped into a bottle of water and shook up to mix. The fire was long since out, save for a few coals deep in the pit, which she snuffed out with a pan of water from the creek. The tent was packed up in moments, once she was done eating, and strapped back onto her pack, with the sleeping bag just below it. She ran a practiced eye over the campsite, and decided there would be nothing left other than the burnt-out ash in the fire pit. Starting the Jeep up, she drove back across the creek and up to the parking spot next to the main trailhead, parked, and got out for one last stretch. Having had some experience, and despite her encounter with Hank the night before, Leslie had prepped a note for her dashboard: **1 ADULT - DEPARTING TO TWIN LAKES 6/6, ESTIMATED RETURN DATE 6/20. NO VALUABLES IN CAR.**. She tucked it under a clip glued just under the windshield, made sure there was nothing inside, took her vehicle registration and other paperwork, and closed the doors. She opened the back, took out her pack and walking stick, put the last items away, hoisted the pack onto her back, locked the car, and set off. The sun hadn’t quite even peeked over the horizon yet. In the distance, Mt. Bachelor was backlit with a violent display of bright red, orange, pink, and purple wispy clouds. The trail to the actual trailhead was a steeply inclined ancient logging road that didn’t even still deserve the term, water-ruts worn in its surface two and three feet deep and the bony knees of tree roots sticking out this way and that. The trailhead always took her a little by surprise. It was terribly marked...which everyone that used it agreed was for the best, since it probably prevented more visitors. Just off the “road”, a little lectern stood, with a notebook inside for signing in/out and a little box of plastic baggies for waste. She signed in, put the date down, and grabbed several bags; she had her own, of course, but it was always good to have extras. Initially, the trail went horizontally along the ridgeline to circuit around a gigantic granite boulder that was roughly the size of an average family home. The switchbacks began, and she could look up the slope through the trees in places and see three or four lines of trail ahead of her. Ancient rotted stumps stuck out of the hillside still, mute testament to the logging efforts nearly a hundred years before, and hidden almost entirely by new growth of trees that were nonetheless four and a half feet, or a meter and a half, in diameter. Squirrels and birds yammered at one another overhead as she climbed patiently. Nearly an hour later, the sun had grudgingly clawed its way over the horizon. Leslie had been taking breaks just about every other switchback, in no real hurry and enjoying the view as she climbed higher and higher. The ridgeline she was making for was something like five *hundred* feet vertical climb in a half mile, which translated to lots of back and forth. Eventually, she came to the last one, before the trail finally turned and headed up and over a saddle, and she found herself looking out across the valley towards the now-risen sun and the peaks of Mt. Bachelor and the Three Sisters off in the distance. Summer or no summer, *those* peaks still had snow and would, she knew, until probably late July or early August. Sunbeams streaked this way and that through early morning mist clinging futilely to tree limbs. *Not a single noise from another human being. Yeah. I needed this.* Leslie turned, and began the last portion of the climb. The trail wended its way eventually to follow the curves of terrain around the peak off to her left, which she could actually see now. It had been obscured from the time she left the trailhead way down in the valley. She had to think for a moment. *What was it named again? Battle Axe?* She nodded to herself. That was it, yeah. Battle Axe. Whether that was because of its edge of volcanic rock and broken boulder fields of granite slabs, or whether someone doing surveys had hated their mother-in-law, she had no idea. As she descended the back side of the ridgeline, the vast fir trees gave way to much smaller vine maples dotted here and there with the bluish color of spruce trees. She was halfway through the first major slope of massive, car-sized boulders, when about twenty feet away, a fuzzy face stuck itself up out of a space and began hollering at her for all the world like some indignant old man yelling at kids to get off his damn lawn. It startled her at first, and then when she began laughing, it stood up on its back feet and continued giving her what-for at the top of its little lungs, undeterred and unconcerned about the Very Large Intruder standing on what she supposed was probably its front porch. “Okay, okay!!! I’m going! I’m *going*, Jesus!” she said, still laughing. She walked away, and began laughing anew when it stopped chattering, then issued a parting shot that almost certainly translated as *Yeah, you* ***better*** *keep walking.* Picking her way across the rest of the boulder field, she wondered idly if everybody got that treatment from what she was pretty sure was a yellow bellied marmot, or if she was the first human it had seen this year. She chuckled whenever she thought about it for quite a while, taking a break at a hundred-year-old benchmark marker that announced that she was at 4,600 feet above sea level. The trail followed the ridgeline, mostly, dropping off one side or the other occasionally to circuit around a large obstacle. Salal, huckleberry, and salmonberry bushes lined the sides of the trail wherever a natural spring bubbled up, giving way to more fir and spruce. Several more large granite boulder fields had to be crossed, but nothing more jumped out at her to announce its displeasure at her presence. Twice, she saw deer in the distance, but they were wary of humans and melted back into the timber before she got anywhere close. By mid-morning, she’d reached the valley. Twin Lakes lay below. The trail here took a sudden hairpin turn to the left and began descending in a long circuit, before finally ending on the valley floor below. About halfway down, she smelled charred wood and spotted a tree split in twain from what was unmistakably a lightning strike. The fire was out, thankfully. Everything was still wet enough that it wasn’t easy to get something burning at this point in the season, but she knew by mid-summer, that would change. She’d have to let Hank know when she came back down; lightning strikes could sometimes ignite the forest duff below the surface, smoulder for weeks, and then flare up when things dried out into an unexpected wildfire. He’d want to come up and have a look. She made a mental note of it, and paused to rest her knees a little. *Almost there.* She wasn’t sure if she intended to stay here for the full two weeks, or if she wanted to go further into the wilderness. This was a good day-hike, but the problem was, it was still only a few hours’ walk from the trailhead, and the longer she was here, the more likely another visitor was. The whole point was solitude...even though other people rarely came up even this far unless they were dedicated about it. “Time enough to consider that tomorrow,” she said out loud, almost to the bottom. This close to the campground, most of the dead brush and trees had been surreptitiously cleared out by other well-meaning visitors who hadn’t brought camp stoves. Hitching rails had been set up by some of the more enterprising folks who came up here with horses or mules, although Leslie couldn’t imagine trying to get a horse trailer in over the access road that led to Elk Lake, much less coaxing a horse to climb up the switchbacks that formed the first part of the trail. She found her intended campsite, screened from the trail down by a truly enormous cedar encircling the spot and leaning out over the lake shore. In the water, blown-down trees lay partly submerged, forming homes and hiding places for frogs, newts, and some fish. Out on the water, bugs flew to and fro, occasionally getting nabbed by the accurate mouth of a trout breaching the surface. Leslie found her tree, where a younger version of herself many years ago had actually carved her initials into the bark, and shrugged her pack off with a relieved sigh. She got a canteen out and drank thirstily. The day passed much as the prior one had, minus a fire. She was mindful of Hank’s warning about fire season; while there weren’t any advisories *yet*, she knew that the conditions up here were still good for a fire getting away from her. Between that and the general lack of other fuel to burn, she elected for a cold camp and called it good. First, the tent went up. She’d left her camp chair in the Jeep after a lengthy back and forth argument with herself about whether the more comfort seating was worth the trouble to lug it up and back down again, and the comfy-chair side of that discussion had, predictably, lost. Overhead, as she erected the poles and hammered the tent stakes into the dirt, a jay squawked obnoxiously, then flew off to look for something more interesting than a lone human. She unrolled her sleeping bag, and set her pack down where it’d be unmolested by enterprising squirrels or nosy birds - not that there was much in there to garner their attention anyway, and all of the food was vacuum sealed anyway, but better safe than sorry. She again got out her fishing pole and embarked on a journey to catch something for dinner. Unlike the previous day, however, she didn’t get any bites immediately, or even within the first hour or so. Undeterred, she moved from point to point, flicking the fly lure out, back, out, back...out….back...out… ...back… Finally, she got a hit, reeling in the wriggling trout and subduing it as she had before. This time, she opted for some additional supplies out of her pack to go with it. Frugally, of course - she had packed in everything else she was going to eat, so the space and weight were at a premium. When night descended, she gratefully fell into her bag, and into a deep sleep. She was never seen on Earth again. --- ***Author’s postscript:*** *So I’m trying something a little different with this one, which will become more clear as we go.

"**Description:** I really wanted to use a twinblade, so I conceived this outfit to match my idea of someone using a twinblade. This outfit is supposed to show off the warrior's strength, agility and mystique.

The hood gives the character a mystique and mostly conceals his/her identity (my character is a she). The fingerless gloves let her feel the handle of the twinblade, whether it is hot or cold she must bear and share the weapon's ""feelings"". Her chest piece protects her body but is light enough to maintain her agile fighting style (also compliments her red hood).

"**JAC @ HOU (HOU -1.5)** \- G Greg Mancz, WR Will Fuller, CB Lonnie Johnson Jr., and S Tashaun Gipson Sr., are all out again. Defensively, this Texans secondary is pretty awful and have no depth with these injuries. However, the biggest injury miss will be J.J. Watt, who is out for the rest of the season with a torn pectoral, badly hurting the quality of the Texans' Pass Rush. This is bad news for the Houston defense overall, as he played a huge part in not only in QB pressure, but in defending the run as well. This will give a big opportunity for Leonard Fournette and the Jaguars' offense, a team who is very familiar playing in London, unlike Houston, where this is their first international game. So Houston's defensive strengths are the pass rush and run defense, but with Watt out, this opens up gaps for Fournette, and more time for Minshew to throw. WR Dede Westbrook is Questionable heading into the London game, which is big, as Minshew usually looks to him on big 3rd down plays, red zone targets, and over the top throws more than any other receiver. Defensively, Jacksonville is missing their 2 starting LBs: Quincy Williams and Leon Jacobs. They were both out last week, but LB Najee Goode is expected to play vs. the Texans, which should bring back some better pass rush to this defense alongside Myles Jack. Bringing down Deshaun Watson will be a challenge because of his elite ability to extend plays with his legs and juke DL-men and Linebackers. Jacksonville's secondary is also nowhere at the 2017 level, but I give them the edge over Houston's, which is much worse. Houston's offense may have a tough time getting things going with Guard Greg Mancz still out, and Laremy Tunsil having an entire week of Limited Practices, and considered Questionable heading into this game. If he is ruled OUT, then Right DE Yannick Ngakoue should have an easy time going through whoever is replacing Tunsil at LT, and pressure Watson immediately. Even when Watson rolls right, he still has to deal with Calais Campbell in front of him. In conclusion, I think the Jags, familiar with playing in London games and the logistics and game preparations that come with playing in a neutral field on the other side of the world, will give Deshaun Watson a tough time getting things going. Houston hasn't been able to get a break from injuries, with Watt, 2 defensive backs, and a starting guard all OUT, and their best OT Questionable. Minshew may be missing his No. 1 target in Dede Westbrook going into Sunday, but they shouldn't have a hard time dealing with the porous Houston secondary, which ranks in the bottom 5 in coverage. I don't think Houston will provide much pressure as they want to on Minshew with the absence of J.J. Watt. I also think in the second half, Watson and the Houston offense will wake up and score points to try to pull away, but Jacksonville will be right there to keep up. At the end of the game, Houston does just enough, again, to pull out the victory. A Jacksonville 6 point teaser makes sense here. The total also is at 46.5 as of this writing, with the implied score: HOU 24, JAC 22.5. I expect both of these teams to get close to these totals. A 6 point teaser on the over makes a lot of sense. **LOCK: HOU ML; 6 POINT TEASERS LOCKS: JAC@HOU OVER 40.5, JAC +7.5.**"
"**KC @ TEN (+6, 49.5; WEATHER: Sunny, 62 degrees, with 11 mph Winds)** \- KC **OUT**: LT Eric Fisher (since Week 2), DE Alex Okafor (2nd straight week). KC **QUEST**: DE Frank Clark (Not played past 3 weeks), G Laurent Duvernay-Tardif (Not played past 2 weeks), CB Kendall Fuller (not played past 3 weeks). TEN **OUT**: LB Jayon Brown (1st week), DT Jurrell Casey (2nd straight week), TE Delanie Walker (3rd straight week). TEN **DOUBTFUL**: WR Corey Davis (1st week). **TENNESSEE:** This is the Titans' 10th straight week playing this season, as their bye week is in Week 11. As a result, their injury report has started to pile up. This will be the 2nd straight week DT Jurrell Casey will not be playing, and while other players in the defensive line , like DaQuan Jones and Jeffery Simmons are more than capable, there is a clear hole in that line. Last week, CAR RB Christian McCaffrey exploited that hole in his big run. Against better offensive lines in their schedule, they have struggled to generate much pass rush. To make it worse, Tennessee also loses LB Jayon Brown this week, and he is the best linebacker on the team. Kansas City's strength is in their passing game, and that doesn't bode well for a defense who's weakest unit is their pass defense. It's not that it's really a weakness compared to other poor secondaries in the NFL, but their rush defense has been dominant this year. Offensively, they will most likely be missing WR Corey Davis to injury, andstill don't have TE Delanie Walker for the 3rd straight week. Results wise, Tennessee has beaten a turnover happy Cleveland in Week 1, an Atlanta team that has given up this season, a Chargers team that almost won if it weren't for a Melvin Gordon fumble on the last play--not to mention the Chargers' OL is absolute trash at protecting Rivers and opening holes for the run game, and the turnover happy Jameis Winston a couple weeks ago, and it took a questionable call from the refs to give Tennessee the game. They are pretty solid defensively, but don't have the offensive firepower to keep up. **KANSAS CITY:** Patrick Mahomes is back, and he will most definitely be fired up to play. This will be the first time since the beginning of the season that he has both Tyreek Hill, Sammy Watkins, and Travis Kelce in the lineup. The Tennessee secondary is more than capable of shutting down opponents, but those three are a different monster entirely, as the secondary unit has not faced this type of trio with this type of QB this year. The QB guru of a HC Andy Reid will make sure he gets Mahomes comfortable and on track. This is an offense that scores their points in bunches, and if Tennessee can't stop that, it will be a long game for them. Yes, KC has been missing their 1st overall pick LT since Week 2, and may be missing their starting guard for the 3rd straight week, but their pass and run blocking has actually been decent this year. Defensively, their pass rush is decent, but will look dominant against this offensive line who is near the bottom of the NFL in sacks allowed. DE Alex Okafor is out for another week, and DE Frank Clark may not play, but they did pretty well to get to Cousins, mainly due to the return of DT Chris Jones, who stopped the run and brought a lot of pressure up the middle. I expect the same when they face Tannehill and Derrick Henry tomorrow. Chiefs' weakness is their secondary, and they will be tested this week, as I predict HC Mike Vrabel will ask Tannehill to throw to keep up. **BETTING:** This depends on how the game starts. If Tennessee can set the tone and hold off Mahomes from the first snap, Tennessee will be able to run their gameplan the way they want to run it, grind out the clock, and score TDs in the red zone, as TEN is 2nd in the NFL in Red Zone TD conversions. This type of game will mean this will be a low-scoring affair. However, given how explosive this KC team is at this point in the season, and how Tennessee is playing their 10th straight week. Kansas City will definitely step on the gas. KC""s secondary is their biggest issue, and I think Tennessee will be able to score some points to get the over. **LOCK: KC -6. TEASE: 6 pts., KC PK, Over 43.5.**"
"**Lhasa, December 24th, 2032** Lieutenant Khanna walked proudly into the streets of Lhasa, a city filled with celebrating Tibetans on this wonderful Christmas day. Tibetan women and children wave their flags freely from the balconies as the Bharati army march into the streets. Tibetan monks forced for year to be tourist attractions waited in the main square of the old city as the Bharati troops were blessed by the Zen monks. ""Thank you,"" the monks said to each of the leaders they blessed. ""Defending our brothers here in Tibet is an honor I will never forget."" Lt. Khanna replied as he performed namaskar to the monks. ""We have finally saved you from the brink of extinction."" Lt. Khanna and his soldiers rested throughout Tibetan homes in the capital and cities around Lhasa. Tibetan families happily welcomed one or two soldiers each as they fed them with celebratory meals. Lt. Khanna's family fed him until he could no longer move. He lay on his bed and heard the horns of the Potala Palace blow before nighttime as news of the Dalai Lama's return was being publicized. **Chinese Arsenal, Qinghai, December 25th, 2032: 13h30** ""cao ni ma!"" shouted a Chinese officer at his commanding leader. The leader swiftly pulled out his gun and shot the officer before he could blink. The officer had disobeyed orders. The leader walked up to the detonator as he waited for President Cai's orders. As soon as he got the go ahead, he twisted the keys and pressed the red button. ""Qi lai! Qi lai! I may not live long but China will!"" The leader shouted as he prepared for the impact within a couple of hours. **Indian anti-ICBM bunker, Kashmir, December 25th, 2032: 13h41** ""Wake up! Wake up!"" Rajeev heard on his radio.

Defend Lhasa!"" the voice on the radio ordered. Rajeev quickly typed the preset locations and pressed *launch* as he started praying to Lord Shiva for blessing. ""Please Lord, may your love for us not die at this moment. We do not deserve what destruction you have in store for us."" **Lhasa, December 25th, 2032: 13h54** Lt. Khanna was walking in the streets as he saw people rushing towards the train stations and caves in the mountains. The sirens were wailing loudly as he ordered his men to move the citizens to a safe place. He knew it was time for himself to reach Bhagavan in heaven but he could not stand seeing any Tibetan faces with the Lord with himself. He ran to the buildings to move people to safety as he started barking orders into his radio. ""Quick, tell Delhi that this is Lieutenant Khanna. I will personally oversee the protection of Lhasa. We only have an hour left but we will try our best. Tell my family how much I love them and tell my country that I will die happy as I have done more good in this couple of months than anyone can ever say. Tell the people of Bharat that I love every single person and I will not see the day Akhand Bharat unites but I will watch with joy from the heavens as my brothers and sisters divided by conflict finally unite under the banner of our Gods. Truth alone triumphs. Jai Hind!"" Lt. Khanna switched off his radio as the message started broadcasting throughout all South Asian and international news channels. The people of Lhasa had no tears left as the Chinese took all they had from them years ago. They sit silently praying for safe passage into the other side. **Potala Palace, December 25th, 2032: 14h22** Perma Metok ran into the Palace where he joined his fellow monks in prayer for the safe passage of Tibet and mercy of Nirvana.

The Bharati air force will launch a series of strategic attacks into China where important military activities undergo. Airplanes will also drop pamphlets of images of the Tibetan genocide and the bombing of Tibet into cities and towns all over the interior of Sichuan and Gansu. BRAHMOS missiles will be launched into China to destroy main army camps and training facilities. Fighter jets will be bombing multiple industrial sectors of China near Tibet and Xinjiang in efforts to cripple the interior of their country. Tibet will always have around 50 fighter jets flying in the skies at all times so that the Chinese will not be able to effectively anticipate the bombings which will occur at least 5 times every 7 days in any random number of Chinese cities. Bharat will arrest every Han Chinese in Tibet and deport them to Bharat where they will be socialised to becoming Bharati citizens [S] effectively make them self-hating and anti-Chinese to be used as spies [/S] and continue their lives here. Any radiated areas of Tibet will be sealed up and protected. Thankfully, the mountains of the Himalayas serve at borders so that the radiation is kept within the bowls of the affected regions and not spread anywhere. Bharat's air force will be on full force to cripple the interior of China specifically targetting army bases, training facilities and industrial sectors for military. Our navy and army will prepare to crush the Chinese on the southern and eastern coast alongside Indonesia, Taiwan, Japan and Korea."
"**Now, what about weed?** It's still smoking something, right? Doesn't smoking also give you cancer? Well, yes, it's supposed to, but it never has. Humans have been smoking cannabis for at least 10,000 years, we quite literally have the archaeological evidence to prove that (Japanese tomb on the Oki Islands dated to 8000 BCE), and never once has anyone ever developed cancer from it, despite us (particularly the US government) *really* looking for those cases and making people smoke weed chronically for 30+ years straight. Let me explain. Smoke from the combustion of any plant material, be it tobacco, cannabis or a leaf from the tree outside, produces a lot of toxins and carcinogens. Even sitting next to a wood-fueled campfire will lead to exposure to these substances, resulting in compromised cardiovascular function and other negative health effects. The pattern of abnormalities associated with cannabis smoking, as has been discovered thus far, seems to differ from tobacco smoking. Smoking anything at all is unhealthy, and if alternative methods of consumption are available, they’re highly recommended above smoking. An important distinction to make here is that the negative side effects of cannabis smoking comes specifically from the combustion of plant matter, not the inhalation of phytocannabinoids, such as THC (the one that makes you high) and CBD. Cardiovascular issues are observed even in studies where all phytocannabinoids have been removed from the smoke inhalation. Alternative methods of smoking cannabis, such as vaporization, edibles, capsules, tinctures, transdermal patches, concentrates and more should be considered if one wishes to avoid the negative side effects. Cannabis smoke differs from that of tobacco in a few notable ways. It contains roughly 20 times more ammonia, 5 times more hydrogen cyanide and nitrogen oxides, but lower levels of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Some studies have refuted the drastically higher ammonia and hydrogen cyanide levels, finding relatively similar levels to that of tobacco, but all studies conclude that there’s less PAHs. Specifically, the carcinogens benzene, naphthalene and toluene have been found in cannabis smoke. Benzene is formed during the natural processes of combustion and can be damaging to the reproductive system when inhaled in very large quantities. Naphthalene is a potential carcinogen, and research on it is lacking. In high concentrations, it’s been shown to destroy red blood cells, and in one severe case was shown to cause organ damage. Toluene is a benzene derivative, though thankfully far less toxic. Overexposure to this compound has been shown to have negative effects on the central nervous system (CNS), as well as symptoms of headaches, nausea, fatigue, sleepiness and irritation of the eyes and upper respiratory tract. An important reminder is that traditional smoking of marijuana will not guarantee any of the above issues; those studies were done under specific circumstances involving unrealistically large amounts of carcinogens, much more than would be produced in traditional smoking, even when taken to the extreme. Even with these facts laid out, it’s simply unfair to compare cannabis smoke to tobacco smoke when you look at the effects caused by long-term smoking. A 2016 study examining chronic marijuana smokers, those consuming a few times a day for more than 20 years, found the only negative health effect to be an increased risk of periodontal disease, a gum infection that can destroy the jawbone if left unchecked. This condition is treatable and typically clears up in a few months. Contrarily, tobacco kills over 480,000 people in the US every year, more than firearms, motor vehicle accidents, HIV, alcohol and all illegal drug overdoses combined. There has never been a verified report of a death from cannabis since mankind began writing, including smoking. Comprehensive and extensive research has been conducted on tobacco smoke, linking it to an array of lung issues, most drastically lung cancer. In contrast, studies conducted thus far have found no link between cannabis smoking and lung cancer, emphysema and respiratory infection. A number of well-designed epidemiologic studies suggest that the risk for lung or otherwise-related cancers from cannabis smoke is far lower than that of tobacco, though a meta-analysis of 19 studies conducted in 2006 found no correlation between heavy marijuana use and lung cancer when factoring out tobacco use. In 2012, Dr. Donald Tashkin, professor of medicine at UCLA, conducted a study examining 5,115 young adults over the course of 20 years, beginning in 1985, and found that marijuana smoke as a whole did not affect the rate of lung cancer among frequent users. Further research suggests that the phytocannabinoids, like THC and CBD, found in the smoke alongside carcinogens may play a role in the lack of cancer from heavy marijuana smokers. Numerous phytocannabinoids and terpenes found in cannabis have been shown to have anticancer and antioxidant properties, and may counteract many of the carcinogens that are also inhaled while smoking. Think of the cancer like a flame, and the cannabinoids like a glass of water. Let the flame spread and get too out of control, and the glass of water won't do much against it (*marijuana can't cure cancer*). Use the glass of water to put the flame out right as it begins, and there won't be an uncontrollable spread (*but it can help prevent it).* How sooner could you use the glass of water than on the same breath? To recap the discoveries of dozens of scientific studies and papers done on this subject, overall, the negative effects of smoking cannabis are much lower than that of tobacco in regards to lung health. Regular cannabis smoking can cause physical airway damage and is associated with an increased risk of periodontal disease. There is no compelling evidence that cannabis smoke leads to obstructive airway disease or emphysema, and evidence suggests it helps to reduce arterial plaque and reduce the inflammation that causes it. A number of high-quality studies have failed to find a link between cannabis smoking and lung or upper airway cancers for occasional, moderate or chronic consumers. To date, despite decades of research, a link between cannabis smoking and lung cancer has never been found. Alternative methods of cannabis consumption, such as vaporizers, edibles, tinctures and more, do not carry any of the risks associated with cannabis smoke inhalation. **More:**"
"**Super Bowl XXXVIII, Patriots defeat the Philadelphia Eagles, 24-21** **Random Recollection:** The last Super Bowl for the original three of Belichick, Weiss (signed to coach Notre Dame), and Crennel (rumored to have the job in Cleveland, but after the game when you saw all three of them hug and huddle for a while you knew he was gone). Injuries all over the place in this game, as the Patriots were down three DBs, forcing them to start Randall Gay, Earthwind Moreland (BONUS: Earth Wind &amp; Fire played the pregame show!), and (sigh) Asante Samuel. The Eagles signed some dude to a one game contract to play TE for them, and T.O. heroically played on one leg after a then-legal horsecollar broke his ankle. For whatever the halftime show was shown in this airing. It was Paul McCartney, starting a trend of super-safe old white rock after Nippplegate the year before. The show was nothing noteworthy, as intended. This game featured a sequence in which (sigh) Asante Samuel picked off a pass in the end zone. It was called back after Roman Phifer, one leg into retirement, had to tackle a receiver so he wouldn’t get open. As a sign of things to come for McNabb, on the next play he threw his first red zone interception of the season, this time without a penalty to bail him out. 14 points were actually scored in the third quarter this time, but again the majority of the points came in the second and fourth quarter. The Eagles time-consuming drive is as bad as you remember. This SB was called by Buck, Aikman, and Collinsworth before he moved to NBC. The talking gets a little busy as you can imagine, since Aikman and Collinsworth both love to take deep dives. Still, it was great to listen to them rip the Eagles in real-time for wasting half of the 4th quarter. **Remembering a Guy:** Jarvis Green, Randall Gay, and Rosevelt Colvin. Green was an off-and-on player who came up big in the AFC championship with 2.5 sacks. The DE got some quality reps on the field with Richard Seymour getting injured all the time in the years that followed, and did the Pats one more favor by signing a 4 yr, 20 million deal in 2010 with the Broncos before getting cut the same year. He notched 5 tackles and a forced fumble in this game. Gay was an undrafted rookie in 2004 (sound familiar?) who got starting time thanks to injuries to Ty Law and Tyrone Poole. Dude had 11 tackles in the Super Bowl, which is great... but also bad since he was a CB. Gay would unfortunately end his time on the Pats with season ending injuries in 05 and 06, before coming back and winning a ring with the Saints. Rosevelt Colvin was an all-pro type of linebacker that fit right into Bill’s archetype for the position. The Pats signed him to a 7-year, $30 million deal that made him the third-highest paid LB in the league. He was a stand-out OLB in a stacked early 00’s Bears defense, so it seemed likely he would live up to the cash. Sadly, he broke his hip socket his first year with the Pats. It’s incredible he even played football again, and after missing all of his first year of the Pats, he won his second ring with the team in a Super Bowl he got to play in. Colvin sadly never regained his incredible quickness, but it was fun to see him play again and force a fumble."

"About a year ago, me and a mate were fucking around above the plane, looking at a small cluster of stars in the region of the [Owl Nebula](https://www.edsm.net/en/system/id/272853/name/GCRV+6897), and we decided we'd go have a look. The person who first went wrote a guide on how to get there, so all we had to do was follow it. Once there, we started looking at the neighbouring systems that EDSM didn't have on the register, and [I found one](https://i.imgur.com/Em5Y7eH.jpg). It stood out to me a lot, because it had a name; this wasn't a procedurally generated star created by the Stellar Forge, this is a [real star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upsilon_Ursae_Majoris) (although in quite a different location). It's also a red giant. EDSM didn't have this one either, which settled it: *I* was going to tag that star. Sadly, the next several hours accomplished nothing. No matter how many systems I found (which proved to be difficult; being that far above the plane, star density is extremely low), I couldn't find a path within my ship's jump range. And I wasn't flying around in no Type 9. I had a fully upgraded and engineered Anaconda that has taken me around the galaxy. 79+ light years on a full tank of petrol, and I still had no hope of making the distances require, even with level 3 jumponium. So I shelved the idea, hoping for future tech to be released that would give me the required range. A few months later I got bored and went back, hoping to find something I missed. And I did. I found a system that bridged the gap, meaning if I could make a jump of 167.12 light years, I could get there. My ship could make 160 when running low on fuel, so I stripped it down, taking off every component that wasn't vital, but all I could reach was around 82 light years. On an empty tank I would've just had enough, but without fuel I can't jump, so the idea was shelved once again. Over the next few months, I would go back and try to find a new path, or attempt to respec my ship for more range, but I never got anywhere. But then yesterday, I finally decided to do what I'd always avoided: fly the extra few light years in supercruise to close the distance, then make the jump once I was in range. So I flew out there, aimed my ship and hit the gas, then left it sit there. It took 7 hours in total, but I finally reached the point when I was in range...but apparently this doesn't actually work in game, so that 7 hours had been a waste. I self destructed to avoid the journey back home. Dejected, I turned to google, to see what the record jump range is, to see if there was some way I could squeeze more distance out of my trusty FSD. And that's when I stumbled upon something called the [One Jump Wonder](https://beta.coriolis.edcd.io/outfit/anaconda?code=A0p3tdFklnd3sxf3----------------3h1O----------.AwRjOV2neqzCA%3D%3D%3D.IwBhrSu6CYekA%3D%3D%3D.H4sIAAAAAAAAA2P8Z8%2FAwPCXCUj8qQcSHC%2BYGRj4Jf78%2Fy%2BWw87A8J%2FpnwRInhEkXwwkRBWA8soGP%2F7%2F%2F8%2F8TwokxQqSqgAS%2FCq%2F%2Fv8X2sHNwCBSI8rAIHEHKPOf5Z8hSBELSD7hA1B%2ByyOgVtZ%2FVnBTW4AE5wWgXVwObAwMilf%2B%2Ff%2BvBCJUQYTaHKDq%2F2z%2FEmA28Ve8ARpy4MH%2F%2F3o230ByDGAAAKrRQ9%2FHAAAA.EweloBhAOEoUwIYHMA28QgIwV0A%3D&amp;bn=One-Jump%20Wonder%20(GFSDB). Look at that range. That's long enough to make the jump! Off I go. Making the way back for the 2nd time that day, I eventually made it to the end of the road, and stared down the 167.12 light year jump ahead of me, with my newly achieved 167.6 range, and hit engage FSD. A short jump later, and I arrived in a system that nobody has ever been to. Another jump, and [I made it](https://i.imgur.com/3CnAbbw.png). Look at that thing. A year of frustrastion, repetition, and trial and error, and it all paid off. That star is *mine*."
"Actually you're wrong if we're being needlessly pedantic: one of the options was:  Meaning if BS are being treated as heroes, CB should be as well. I really don't see this false choice situation you're convinced exist, so either you're being intentionally dishonest (to what end, distract from the main point?), or unintentionally (reading comprehension problems?). So kindly, and this is the second time I request this of you, stop red-herring this whole discussion (or don't, but at least answer), and answer the simple question. I'm sure you don't need me to repeat it."
"Again not in the red zone - in the western part of town which is nice. However EQC repairs just started on my property this morning and I had all of two days warning. So sorting alternative accommodation is going to be fun. Went to work with my wallet, phone charger, laptop and passport - all the essentials. Yes the CBD sucks but it is interesting to see new things constantly popping up. Previously the state of the food/beverage scene was a bit ho hum with it being dominated by a handful of business owners. When one bar/restaurant closed down it would be replaced by something similar with a new coat of paint. Now we're seeing innovative funky new establishments popping up all the time and the old guard of Lion Nathan/DB controlled bars well gone. If anything it's made me re-asses how I spend my time, find new things to do and explore. The past three years certainly has felt like an eternity but it really does seem we're on the cusp of something new and exciting."
"All, I'm working on a 5k vanilla peaceful megabase, [coming along nicely](https://imgur.com/7Y4Ox5K) so far. I've got direct to train miners, 350% mining prod, mostly solar power (10GW nuke on standby for spikes) and a giant bot based science &amp; rocket facility. Major bottlenecks are the raw materials, as to be expected. I'll keep working on it. Anyway: I noticed that my [green science](https://imgur.com/F4rwOZ5) isn't performing as well as expected. Following [Kirk's instructions](https://kirkmcdonald.github.io/calc.html#zip=bY1LCsMwDERv41UENm5TcNFhHFsUU3+E5ECP32YTCBSGWbzHMDnOiBbcA5xJjN600vFmNqoT6cNCqjAlduUhEw5sGsvI6Kw1uSF7kzfUoxO61ZRJTbGOV9FZEmgq1BMBx/QOEu72t2oj75UUS1eSSRLUn1muXxeVBjMJDKGTPftea3DrUmT0v+YL), I have 4 inserter assemblers, 2 belt assemblers, and 10 gear assemblers (Shared between red and green science). However, many of my green science assemblers don't have inserters in the requestor chest. All of the passive provider chests are locked at one slot to prevent huge buffers. This is turning out to be a bottleneck: **All of the passive provider chests are locked at one slot.** Here is what I am observing: The assemblers are working at crafting speed 8.75, so one inserter takes 0.5 / 8.75 = 0.057 seconds to craft, or 17.5 inserters per second. This fills up the passive provider chest in three seconds, triggers 50 bots to take off, and while it waits for the bots to pick up the inserters, **the assembler stops.** The solution here, is then to make sure the output buffer is large enough to allow enough inserters to pile up to cause enough bots to take flight to enable your throughput. I'd love help here on calculating the correct buffer size. Throughput is **not** limited by the number of bots - I have 10k bots avilable out of 16k total right now, for example. I'll add bots if needed. Throughput is being limited by the number of bot commands issued at once due to the available slots in the passive provider chests. Anyone else ran into this? Calculated it? Have a better write up than me? Thanks!"
"And from the CBO link you posted:  This is going to turn into another BS statistic that'll be used against the AHCA. Without a requirement to be on insurance, of course we'll see drops in people covered. Why doesn't this report have an estimate on growth in the insured? As for the Medicaid issue:  The Medicaid expansion was never a mandate, a bunch of red states opted out from the beginning. If more states follow through, well, that's a state's rights issue. Medicaid itself isn't even a federal mandate, but every state participates in the program. If people want to be mad at Trump, your anger is misdirected. States that drop expansion coverage down to minimum standards are decisions made by your local representatives. So to sum this up, Trump shouldn't drop his support of the AHCA. He's literally just allowing individual states to control their healthcare themselves with less federal involvement."
"And the red shield without the yellow background, both or which aren't seen outside of the CBS version."
"As a Chelsea supporter and neutral, I think Demichelis works best when he is in command of the defense just like he was at Malaga. I was also on the anti-Demichelis bandwaggon until I watched the City - Hull match, where Kompany was given a red. Up until then, City was conceding a bunch of stupid goals from horrific errors, and when Demichelis stood up to the plate, City kept a clean sheet. So this made me realize that Kompany and Demichelis were not understanding each other, and errors were made by each other to cover up from each other's mistakes. I think there has been a massive misunderstanding about Demichelis from outsiders, and I think he is a decent CB and understand now why Pellegrini plays him often. Just my two cents."
"As an aside, I wish rookie contracts had some sort of red shirt-esque clause. If a player sits out for his first or second season, the team can postpone the team option by one year under the player’s rookie scale. The red shirt salary could be used as an exemption against the cap for one year, vet minimum deals. So in this year we’d pay Giles this season under his first year salary, but for all intents and purposes the next season would be at the same amount and the team option would be pushed back a year. It gives the team more leeway in resting young players who deal with injuries, and it gives young players an extra year of guaranteed money if their injury is serious and career ending. It would also make teams more likely to take risks on a young injured player without worrying about a wasted contract years or cap space. A team could earnestly rehab a player instead of rushing them back on the court. It would open up roster spots for minimum vets (who carry a lot of weight in CBA negations), lead to more focus on player safety, and put more money into players pockets in general."
"As soon as I walk in, I see three red dots in my radar and Elisif says something to the effect of ""you shouldn't be here"" so I assume that for some reason they reacted negatively to my arrival, but I had no idea why. I walk up the stairs to see what the fuck is going on, and I discover that the three or four dots on my radar aren't Elisif and her crew, but it's Jarl Igmund [formerly of Markarth, I just overthrew him and helped the Forsworn take over](/spoiler) and his crew. I tried to kill them because I assumed that [it was part of the quest from Markarth](/spoiler), but instead of dying when he reaches 0 hp, he just hunches over for a few seconds and then gets back up with full health to fight another day. What the hell is going on?

"Awesome! Yours is definitely easier on the eyes and more informative than the original. Vast improvement, I think. I also like how you got rid of the unnecessary gradients off to the side of the left panel and instead are using the gradients to indicate actual information. (Although I'm not a huge fan of gradients used for informational purposes to begin with.) Some constructive criticism: I don't think you needed to bring everything into 80% Title Safety. The 90% Action Safety has sort of become the ""new"" Title Safety with modern HD TVs. [Here's a good guide](https://www.hdhead.com/illustrations/720_safe_chart.jpg) (I don't like using the default Photoshop guides) As someone who's just starting out not knowing much about Formula E, it might help me to have a guide of what indicators do what, and why you chose certain colors for the different gradients. There's just a lot of different colors going on here, and it's very busy. But right off the bat, the pink/lime green combo is pretty weird and feels out of place. Pink is not often used in TV graphics, for a number of reasons. Is there a particular meaning to those particular colors as it pertains to Formula E? A red-to-blue gradient is also always a difficult one to pull off. It always ends up going purple/pinkish in the transition, which never really looks great (see [CBSN's ""Red &amp; Blue""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tszy3sbHSPk) show). Is there a reason that the baby blue arrow has a gradient transparency in its tip in the #14 ROW line? Shouldn't it be a solid with a hard edge? Is there a reason it doesn't extend all the way to the gray? If you're making the choice to go with Tricodes instead of full names, then you can get away with shortening the row lengths of the panel on the left, which will also help the graphic not to encroach. However, as a newcomer, I'm thankful for the spelled out names in the original. I'm also not a fan of the chevron/arrow textures in the lower 3rd racer name bars. It's a bit busy, and some sponsors will have a problem with their logos being over textures, so I would either knock the texture back by at least 30% or get rid of that texture altogether. Great choice to have the racer headshots contained within the bar (I've always hated having heads extend above the bar). The flag behind the head is a nice touch (much better than how they had them on the left panel), but I would play with the radial gradient on those as well, maybe lightening it a bit, or getting rid of it altogether. The thin font used for the +6.489 number in the blue tab is harder to read than the original. I would go with a bold condensed instead of a light condensed. Also, the bottom of the panel on the left is not aligned with the top of the lower 3rds. I would either bump the left panel up 10px, or bring it down to action safety on the bottom. There's so much I would change about their original design and also yours (although yours IS a definite improvement on theirs!), if I get some time I might start redesigning it from scratch. I would need some sort of a guide to what information is really needed/wanted by the fans."
"BCBS? Are both of these doctors OD or is one of them MD? Do they both practice in an office type setting? If both doctors are in network? I do not know why an office visit would be other than your $50 copay. My best guess would be the receptionist hasn't checked your insurance benefit and doesn't want you to expect a $50 Office visit copay when your problem might need a in office Surgery code. It's safer to quote high and then apply your correct charge a checkout rather than quote $50 and your procedure is a surgical benefit subject to your deductible and ends up costing you $100+. In the office I work in I always tell front desk people to quote our selfpay price. Too many people come in here saying they have a red eye which would be $50 office visit but turns out they have metal in their eye and its coded for a in office surgery $100+. Surgeries are often subject to your deductible which you have to pay before your insurance pays anything for your visit whereas office visits aren't subject to a deductible, only a, in your case $50, copay."

To use, attach a red wire to the top with the appropriate inputs, and optionally replace/reprogram the speakers and bottom row of combinators. --- It is organized into 31 almost-independent columns: they share the same input, but everything else is duplicated for each one. I mostly used magic numbers when constructing it instead of calculations to make it smaller. The top row is a bitwise-AND filter. It takes the input signal, splits it into powers of two, and only passes it on if it has that part. For example 219 is 1 + 2 + 8 + 16 + 64 + 128, so it would pass through the filters in columns 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 and 8 (and go on to play a chord of those six notes). The second row essentially returns [log2(input) + 1]. This means that the 1, 2, 8, 16, 64, and 128 output from the top row is converted into 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 and 8 so that the speakers can be used on [set pitch] mode. This is done by subtracting a magic number from each input signal in each column. After that is the speakers, simply set to [signal 0, piano, set pitches] mode. The input above would make a chord of F3, F#3, G#3, A3, B3, C4. The bottom row of combinators transposes the signal up two octaves (by adding 24), and passes it on to the second row of speakers, which read signal 1 instead of signal 0. --- Other things you can do with the setup: - Use one signal for ""loud piano"" and one for ""quiet piano"" by having two sets of speakers set to different volumes - Intrinsically play chords, by having multiple speakers (separated by combinators that add a certain value) all set to the same signal. - Visualize it with lights instead of listening with speakers. --- Known issues: - Going from C#, E, F, A to 71936 is a pain, and probably best solved by using the space saved in the synthesizer to have a sane setup for storing the data. - Using an arithmetic combinator to change keys delays it by 1 tick. Solvable by ""changing"" key for *every* speaker, even if it is changed by 0."
"Boyce, Dobson, and Tyms will be having an interesting play for a WR slot. Dobson is getting put into redzone packages with Gronk, Chandler, and Edleman. Boyce appears to be Jimmy's go to target after day 2. And Tyms is still Tyms with his hype train rolling to see if he has a shot of breaking out this year. Chandler is going to be TE2 across from Gronk. Amendola is walking with some serious swagger now that he's in the system *and* he'e finally fucking healthy. He has the potential to be a 1,000 receiver this year because regardless of what many Pats fans think, Danny is fucking good as a WR. Gronk, interestingly, shed the knee brace on Day 2. He looks as healthy as every. Edlemen is picking right up where he left off last year. Our receiving corp is going to be really good again. Jake Bequette is playing TE pretty well, switching from DE. He will be a rotational guy there for sure. Honestly, with our TE corp here I hope eventually Hooman gets the axe. I don't understand McDaniels fascination with him. He's very, very mediocre and I wish we would have kept Wright instead, but oh well. LaFell, unfortunately, is on the PUP list last I recall. Amendola looks like he's going to be the primary kick returner again. Some other guys are cycling in and out but they're just going to be depth. Danny is the guy here. Blount looks like a god damn beast and I'm not sure how he failed his physical because instead of that slow rolling avalanche type runner he was last year he's looking more explosive off the first step. The guy has his issues but damn does he love playing on the Pats and winning. He will be the RB1 coming out of pre season and he's going to run over the colts again this year, hard. He's looking leaner, hitting holes faster, and just generally looks like a monster. The receiving RB battle is pretty tight between White and ~~the undrafted guy (who's name escapes me at the moment)~~ Cadet. Mayo is looking good but still rusty. I wouldn't be shocked if he gets bumped to rotational guy in the linebacker corp for the start of the season. Sheard is looking pretty good so far and will likely be a rotational piece as well (like we expected) but he's making a good transition to our defensive scheme. Collins is fucking nuts already. He popped Dobson in full contact for a fumble. Hightower had a red no contact jersey on as he is going to be paced into the pre season recovering from surgery. Collins looks like the best defensive player on the field though. He's explosive, athletic, showing awesome intelligence and quick to the point of contact. Too early to start arguing for top 5 linebacker in the NFL? Maybe. But he's making so very good arguments. Jordan Richards looks incredibly good. Like once again Bill Belichick knew something everyone else didn't and grabbed a fucking diamond in the shit heap good. He's been incredible in every practice so far and had one spectacular pass defended against the 6'8"" Chandler where Brady delivered a gorgeous pass that only Chandler should have been able to get. The two guards we drafted are taking the bulk of first team snaps. They are looking very good and will help anchor the line this season with the loss of leadership in guys like Connolly. Hopefully it also means Jordan Devey never sees the field. Malcolm Butler will be a starting CB. He looks very good out there and will do a great job stepping into the hole left by Revis. He's not in the same class, but do not fear Pats fans, our secondary isn't as bleak as you think it is. Darryl Roberts and Robert McClain are fighting it out for the final CB spot on the team. They've both had pretty good camp so far and it's uncertain which it will go to. Bradley Fletcher is better than most people realize. He led the league last year with passes defended. People want to rip on him because the Eagles thought it would be a great idea to use him one on one against guys like Dez Bryant, DeSean Jackson, and Jordy Nelson. No shit he had some bad days. Here though, he looks pretty good and the second CB slot will be his. Cardona needs to work more on a relationship with the place holder and Ryan Allen. His snaps are so powerful that he's caught them off guard a few times and caused it to bobble. But if they get used to it at full speed that extra half second or so will reduce the chance of punt. Our D line is looking great. Brown is sitting really well into the interior of the defensive line. he's no Wilfork but if he carries this over into the regular season, he's going to do really well and our front 7 is going to be fucking terrifying. I don't have much to say about Easley yet as he was finally cleared from the PUP list but he's playing well. I really hope the kid works out because he had such high hopes in the NFL. Chandlar Jones is fucking Chandlar Jones. He's going to continue to make steps this year. My favorite position battles to watch: - WR: Dobson and Boyce - Safety: Jordan Richards and Patrick Chung.  Overall: I didn't get to watch everything in the camps and tried to piece together a few others things from some media notes, but overall, it looks like everyone is having a really, really good camp. Jimmy G has nice tight spirals. Brady is Brady. The receiving corp is going to be really good this year if everyone carries over like they are playing now into the regular season and will only look scarier if/when LaFell comes back and is at form (I swear to god he can have a 1000 yard, 5+ TD season if he gets healthy and up to speed by day 1). The D line is looking great but has some questions. Alan Branch failed his physical and I don't know if he's come back yet but Antonio Johnson is filling in pretty well and I wouldn't be surprised if he's going to be around after the final cuts. Health issues are pulling slowing down the line backer high light reel but that will be resolved as guys get healthy again, but they still look great. The o line looks like it will be established in game 1 with no more of the rotational experiment bull shit. Our secondary is going to be good, especially with how improved out front 7 looks. Believe in Belichick guys."
"CBT? I'm in a much different place now than I was 10 months ago. I started going to therapy for what I was eventually told is functional depression. I had active thoughts not of killing myself, but how nice it would be to be dead. Every day was groundhog day. Life was pointless. I am just a cog in the wheel and at some point I will be replaced with another cog in the wheel that doesn't know any better. At first it was every two weeks, and then I bumped it to weekly because I wasn't seeing results. Are you familiar with the phrase death by a thousand cuts? Therapy is healing by a thousand tiny steps. First it started with gratitude exercises, which I thought were absolutely bullshit. Take 10 things a day you're grateful for and repeat them to yourself. Like, I'm grateful I missed that red light I always catch on my way to work. I'm grateful to have a caring girlfriend who loves me. Shit like that. Next it was just completely switching up my routine and doing something different. Instead of going home and going straight to video games with a beer in front of me to get out of my head, my girlfriend and I would go to the beach for a walk or around our neighborhood. Then we would plan and cook elaborate meals. In the mornings I would wake up early and stretch instead of just waking up, getting ready for work, and walking out the door. Then there's the talking about shit part in therapy. By saying stuff and having a trained professional as a sounding board, they become an interactive mirror. They take the shit you say and put it to you differently. They force you to look at it from a different perspective. They help you unearth the why behind the way you look at everything. Because we are human and have the ability of language, there's a constant dialogue going on in our heads 24/7/365. As stupid as this sounds, you basically have to ninja mindfuck yourself out of this thing you do that you seemingly have no control over because you've never been presented with the tools. These tiny changes should eventually lift the thick film of shit from your perspective on life. There's a book called Get Out of Your Mind and Into Your Life. Here's an Amazon link: https://www.amazon.com/Get-Your-Mind-Into-Life/dp/1572244259 I'd suggest using that in conjunction with a therapist. Even though I'm not perfect and I still have the occasional issue with alcohol, I'm light years ahead of where I was less than a year ago. I'd also suggest finding a therapist in your age range, and preferably a woman. But you do what makes you comfortable. Good luck."
"Combine is big- speed, acceleration, and explosiveness make the best ""skill position"" players (all of the positions you mentioned are included in the term). Defensive backs are often first looked at for having height, (5'10 can work but would be small, 6'3 is about the tallest you see a successful NFL CB) while still maintaining high speed/acceleration. Acceleration, ability to change speed and direction quickly, is almost more important than speed in coverage, so all shuttle drills are important. Generally this is what makes the difference in Corners and Safeties- Corners can change directions more quickly, making them more suitable for coverage, while Safeties can be just as fast but may be a bit stronger/not as focused on coverage (they're needed to stop the run, too). There are certainly exceptions to this though- i.e. Derwin James can cover the whole field and still stop the run as a rookie. Check out his combine for a good reference for a today's athletic prototype of a Safety. As for stats to look at, Defensive Backs are mostly looked at in terms of *big plays*. No one notices them until they pick it off and run it back, or let up a 60 yard TD bomb. Thus, at least look at turnovers as well as TDs allowed, and maybe tackles for safeties, when comparing. Wide Receivers can be even more difficult to grade because it is very easy for someone to do well at one level and completely bomb it and the next. They are also heavily dependent on their teammates and systems to get good looks, making finding a stud receiver difficult amongst the many in an increasingly pass-heavy NCAA. However, there are some basic starting points. Completion percentage and number of targets to drops are vital to hands talent, but again this can be altered by good/bad teammate play and not just speak to the receiver. Combine stats are still crucial- anyone these days that isn't at least 6'0 better have sub 4.50 speed if they want a shot at a first round pick today. Acceleration becomes just as important for them as it is for Corners, as it is Corners they are trying to escape to make plays. When judging WRs for your own sake of comparison, there are a shit-ton of ways to look at it. For players in run-heavy, play-action based systems, look for big plays off fake hand-offs to red-zone threats, making them more definable by their yards and TD production. Meanwhile, guys like Michael Thomas thrive on efficiency, Antonio Brown route-running, OBJ crazy hands, etc. Being a position group that not only allows for, but almost requires, diversity, you see a lot of different styles that are hard to compare. It is much more difficult to say who the very best WR is than most positions because there are so many styles (i.e. OBJ, Antonio Brown, D-Hop, and Julio have all 'been the best' in at least one aspect of WR play in the past 5 years). &amp;#x200B; In reality there are thousands of factors for every position to look at, but physical athleticism and position-based skills are where to start imo. Hope this was informative, if anyone has anything to add/ doesn't agree with me, lmk and I'll edit/add!"
"Cool, I've been doing my research and since I have an NZXT S340 I was thinking of going with the pump+res units but some of the clear pumps like that look really cool. I just wasn't sure if that's what they were at first lol. My Christmas wish list is fittings, acrylic tubing, and a heat gun so I can learn how to make bends and stuff. I don't want people buying me expensive stuff like blocks or rads so that's all I put on there. I might get a better case and motherboard too if I go this route. Right now my GPU is on an AIO and it works beautifully but I'm getting the itch. So my plan is to sell off all my extra hardware and use that money to rebuild. My motherboard does not do my system justice. I have a 2700 on a gigabyte GA AB350 Gaming 3 and it's so meh. Need something with solid vrms and none of those red accents on the PCB. I wanna go all white, tempered glass, and nickel."
"Cullen Jenkins can't play even close to what he used to, neither can Mike Patterson. Canty is better than both. Mark Herzlic hasn't done anything worth a damn on a football field size BC. Dan Connor is a nice player though. What makes you think Webster is getting any better this season? He's never been very fast and his lack of speed had become a huge liability the older he's gotten. TT is coming off of 2 ACL tears. You'd best expect nothing from him. I'm not on the Prince hype train. He's not bad, probably our best CB, but he isn't anything special. Aaron Ross is a good pick up. Tuck isn't young anymore. I'm hoping he comes back in a big way, but I don't think he can bring it like he used too. That plus JPP coming off back surgery are two huge red flags to me. Losing Osi, even though he wanted much more than he's worth, was a blow. And to top it all off, our DC is terrible. Edit: Whoever fucking downvoted this sucks at reddit."
"Currency rates are not indicative of a country's economy. Hyper inflation and huge swings in currency rates are a red flag that it is being mismanaged, but a snapshot of a rate tells you little about a country's economy. In this specific case, that rate can help you understand today's situation. The US Federal Reserve was more aggressive about bond repurchases than the ECB, at least initially. It purchased toxic assets with newly created dollars in an attempt to stave off another crisis. The ECB was incredibly reluctant to do the same, largely, in my opinion, because of Germany's reluctance to such a program (although it used other tools to try and combat the crisis). As I said, a huge swing can be destabilizing in itself, so the ECB does not want to dump Euros on the Eurozone to purchase bonds of troubled countries all at once because businesses base future projections on current exchange rates and the assumption they will be relatively stable. But it is and has been steadily purchasing debt from troubled nations in the EZ. It often is the largest purchaser at new issuances of debt by struggling Eurozone economies, so it is clear its stance has drastically changed. Also, as I said before, Germany does not seem to be on board with a large devaluation through quantitative easing (buying bonds with newly printed Euros). The Fed also has a dual mandate, low unemployment and inflation, whereas the ECB only has one mandate, to control inflation. So it has also been argued the ECB does not have the same tools in its belt as the Fed when it comes to determining ""whats best"" for the economy. It could be argued if the ECB targeted problem areas as quickly as the Fed the exchange rate might be lower compared to the USD, but European economies could very well be doing better than they are. A low exchange rate also promotes exports, which would be helpful for Europe's struggling economies. So it is very likely if the exchange rate was closer to US$1.10 to €1 the Eurozone economies could actually be much better off. **TL:DR: taken by itself an exchange rate snap shot does not tell us much about an economy. Although trends can be indicative of problems or stability.** (Sorry in class so might not be worded as well as I would normally like it to be)."
"Democrats seem to be lowering the margins by which they lose some red states over this new century. For example, look at the margin by which they've lost Texas. By 21% in 2000, by 23% in 2004, by 12% in 2008, by 16% in 2012... **by 9% in 2016.** Maybe extrapolating is wrong, but by my shitty statistical analysis, Texas should go blue in 2028. If Democrats lose Texas by less than 6% in 2020, they'd be ahead of schedule... Personally, I think the internet plays a huge role in this. Information is more easily available, and while echochambers can be created, the members of them might get a glimpse of the truth they wouldn't have, had it not been for the internet. The policies proposed by the left just *seem* to be better. They *seem* to promote better societal and economic development. To quote a certain president of ours [""The economy just seems to do better under democrats. We've had economic trouble under democrats and republicans... but we've had some serious disasters under republicans""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCB6RvRojIQ&amp;ab_channel=StandCalifornia)"
"Depends on the color of red and blue. Is it a salmon or Nantucket red? Or a fire engine red? Is it a navy blue, pale blue, royal blue? Different things go with each one. Best bet is something simple like a white OCBD with the red, a white or pale pink with the blue. But like CuntyMcCunt also mentioned, cargo shorts are usually a bad place to start anyway, so matching colors may not be the first thing you need to be worried about."
"Depends on you spanish fluency, or at least how well you can learn a new language, which they have a test for (I looked into it 10 years ago) if you are not spanish proficient but cna pass the language learning test (which isnt really a test about a language it's about the ability to learn symbols.) then you are on to the polygraph and background test. then a few (several) weeks in training and you'll be off to CBP.

"Do you have something special for previous backers? (Like the custom engraving on the Time series) Now that the PT2 series is coming out, will there be a drop in the prices of the old models? Are you planning on dropping some of the older SKUs? (Like maybe the Pebble Steel?) Is the display on the new PT2 different from the PT or is it just the same display without the big bezel that covers it? Can it show more colours on the screen? When do you plan to launch the PT2 in India via direct sales? Also, on Amazon.in, the PT in red and white costs Rs. 9999 but the PT in black costs Rs. 18,450. Which is ridiculous, considering that the PTS costs only Rs. 15,999. I feel this is a mistake, but thought I'd point it out.

"Do you live near a micro center? If so you might be able to get that processor + Z97 for a pretty good deal. Also, that motherboard is pretty cool don't get me wrong but if you don't need all those features than you might just want to consider getting a cheaper board with features you think will need. I personally love high end boards and if you got the money they usually are 100% worth it in my opinion. For the RAM, personally from experience I would suggest getting cheaper sticks. I know the RAM you have is 2133 but RAM speed doesn't really impact performance if that makes any sense. DDR3-1600 and up, CAS 10 and below, 1.5v and below, 2x8GB should be around 85-110$. When choosing RAM things I like to consider is the size (low profile sticks are pretty cool), what color the PCB is, what color the heat sink is, how big the heat sink is... (just things to think about). For the PSU I would try and get a 850W good series one. To give you a bit of head room if you plan on adding things down the line (like SLI, more drives, lighting configuration, fans...) (that's assuming you will, you might even be fine with a 650W if not). I'm like you and tend to lean at the moment to single card setups (hopefully in future SLI configurations will improve drastically). I currently have a GTX 780 in my build with tons of fans, drives, add on things, and I'm looking at 600W. If I wanted to SLI in the future I definitely would have to upgrade my PSU (got a Capstone 750W). For the WD Black, from experience and from reviews they tend to get a bit loud. Also, 4TB drives are usually over priced. I would suggest looking into 3TB drives and maybe picking up a 1-2TB drive for back up purposes (assuming you have important files to back up). I know a lot of people like just cloning drives/setting up RAID configurations, I personally would recommend downloading a syncing program (like Microsoft SyncToy 2.1) so you can choose which folders and files get backed up instead (this is for personal use, if you are more doing some commerical/high end stuff RAID setups can be really nice and give you a super nice safety net). I personally like Corsair fans. I bought 120mm Air Flow fans (haven't installed them yet) and for the amount of air and how quiet it is on max is really nice). However, they are a bit pricey; there might be other brands out there that offer red/black theme and same performance. Keyboard, I personally have the Razer Chroma and love it. RGB keyboards are so cool and so helpful. I really think they are the future of keyboards for sure. My brother recently bought the Corsair K95 RGB Red switches and it is a really nice keyboard. I think build quality Corsair wins/also with software, but Razer lighting seems a bit better. The K70 RGB you have is definitely a bit overpriced (should be around 130-140$). I would suggest going with the K95 RGB assuming you have the desk space. Having those extra keys to the left is super nice."

"Edit: Guys, please read the creator's response below. His website sucks, but his product actually has some cool features [Imgur Mirror](http://imgur.com/a/GG5OM) Also note, at the bottom of the page is a link to ""Our simple and user-friendly configurator software"" that is literally a copy/paste of the massdrop configurator. Highlights: ""Everybody likes high tech gadgets. Our's[sic] is different""  ""You will find these features all together only in the Ergofip©. No Jokes. It's the only keyboard in the world which has those features."" (Bonus points for not understanding the difference between © and ® and ™)  * Healthy: reduces carpal tunnel withe adequate (wtf?) position of the hands * Good-looking: you'll be the only one to have such a pretty keyboard (why do they keep harping on the uniqueness of it I wonder?) * Fast: mechanical keyboards are known to have a faster response time (since when?) * Easy to configure * Silent? Clicky? Noisy? We'll provide you with black/brown/blue/red switches * Macros: You can customize your keyboard According to the ""timeline"" he had this ""geek's keyboard idea"" in 2012, acted on it in 2014 by buying a bunch of different keyboards to see what they didn't have, they ""designed the electronics"" in the first quarter of 2016, and ""designed the configurator"" in the second quarter 2016, and now they're launching a crowdfunding campaign. ----- Okay, so in the process of writing this I did find a reference to Ergodox on the page (for some reason ctrl-f didn't catch it when I found this yesterday), in the context of comparison with other ergonomic keyboards. ""Ergofip reduces (maybe eliminates, which was the case for Olivier Pons, the creator of the Ergodox©) the carpal syndrome[sic]"" &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Edit: oh shit, wait a minute, Olivier Pons is also the founder of this project. Edit2: well then somebody's a liar, because according to Deskthority, Ergodox was invented by Dominic Beauchamp (Dox) with PCB designed by Fredrik Atmer (bpiphany), not this Pons guy. I think they intended to write ""creator of the Ergofip©"", because a couple of years ago, Pons [built an Ergodox from a kit](http://www.olivierpons.fr/ergodox/1-ergodox-reception-et-montage/), which should put him solidly in the ""not the creator"" category. Edit3: In case anyone's curious, I came about these guys because Olivier Pons went live coding for this website on Livecoding.tv yesterday, and since I also do some Django stuff, I got a random email notification. I usually ignore them, but I saw he was doing something keyboard related so I checked it out."
"Education, infrastructure, and police training. As much as i'm for legalization with taxation i'm also a realist. Decriminalization is the first step in this heavily red state. Hell many counties as well as districts are that way now and they have had a chance to focus on other things. Look at the sale of hemp and hemp products. The fact that we have CBD stores is already a big step in the right direction. If we are fighting for legalization it's a losing battle until we have a federal change. But to be honest we are only a few years off from that."
"Eh. this is kinda right. while you can't always do mid-combo if you catch the tell's early enough you can GP into safety. Ive done it many times. many fails too. and Also GP sword-&gt;axe has less delay that flat guarding after you finish a combo. Making GP a safer option IF you are good with timing moves. I think people use GP for different reasons. I use it to save my hide, counter into a different move and to charge my shield. The damage on it is just bonus.  The thing about CB is that it is suppose to be a blend of the two modes. Its NOT suppose to be like switch axe where you can master one or the other mode. The CB isn't suppose to be as protective at all times like a LC but You can be protectived 99% of the time as long as you aren't attacked to axe mode.  I think this is primary where you and I disagree on our points. I see guard points as defensive and you see them as offieentce. I think they aren't offensive because the damage is pathetic,but nice to have, but they provide an innate guard +1. You can play CB where all you do is counter (pretty much how I play) and charge during the down time. I think the full potential of CB is you get your red shield and phials. then attack using shield thrust and/or charge A, when monster attacks your GP, if you have enough time you AED if not just counter with a switch to axe then switch back to sword. That's how I see the basics to charge blade. You should NEVER switch to axe only for damage unless monster is down."

"Even when I do go the extra step and choose main pieces of my outfit in complimentary colors, I like them to be more neutral. For instance, around Christmas time, I paired a pair of more neutral Salmon red chinos with a darker hunter green/forest green v-neck merino wool sweater, and a light blue OCBD underneath. The red was not fire-engine red and the green was not a kelly green. Looking back at photos, sure I was wearing red and green, but they were more neutral versions of those colors, and they didn't stand out so much, but still enough to add a little extra pop for the occasion and holiday spirit."
"Exhaustion hadn't quite taken hold as I neared the only beacon of United States pop culture within hundreds of miles. With grant money being so tight these days the University was forced to ""collaboratively consolidate."" Hence the two dozen disparate research projects that utilized the small prefabricated buildings ahead of me. Close to a hundred students relied on this node as a connection to home. Many of them focused on the hour or two a week they could spare to stay in touch with loved ones. I had come to organize my weeks around *Shiny the Ghost Hunter* and a cold beer. The four beige boxes that comprised the Elwood-Carnegie Andes Outpost Beta rested on a small plateau in Ecuador about halfway up the mountainside so that it was accessible to research teams above and below. There was just enough room remaining for a bumpy helipad. A weekly delivery of supplies kept this place alive. Most weeks there would be even more traffic - dropping off or picking up teams usually, although sometimes the jungle researchers would stumble across some compound that promised to have a capacity for profit and our industry partners would rush it back to the Norther hemisphere. My destination this evening was the rec room. Besides that there was a cold storage for food, samples, and medicine, a bathroom with showers, and a bunk with a dozen cramped beds. Those were typically reserved for teams returning from more far-ranging projects. Tents and hammocks were always preferable to that stuffy, stinky box. I opened the flimsy screen door and stepped into the rec room. Rohan and Tyler were occupying two of the several folding chairs facing the television. Ellen, one of the few colleagues who I liked rather than tolerated, had her eyes glued to a chemistry journal. All three spent their days collecting rare specimens of flora and fauna and extracting whatever unique compounds they could. Ronald Reagan's withered face shone out of the television in grainy relief, while Rohan and Tyler held a distracted conversation. ""You know that television belongs to me in six minutes."" It wasn't a question. Anyone who didn't know the television was mine every 8 PM Eastern/7 PM Central on Thursdays was quick to learn with an earful from me. Tyler glanced at me with a worried look on his face but turned back to Rohan and the television. ""Hey Ellen. Want a beer?"" I asked while walking up to the small table her reading material rested on. She held up a finger while her gaze remained fixed on the journal. I stared at the tight, blonde braids on her head before trying to make out the title of of what she was reading, but she prevented me by gently closing the front cover. ""Hello Maria. Yes please, a beer would be lovely."" Ellen tried very hard to maintain a reserved demeanor but her frustration with others often leaked out. I'm not sure how obvious her adopted behavior is to others, since she's probably been affecting it since childhood. It wouldn't have been noticeable to me if I hadn't met her parents during our undergrad years. I walked next door into the cold storage building and opened up the walk-in cooler reserved for food and medicine. With so many people there wasn't much room, and mine was dedicated to a six pack of miller lite. I only drank one frosty beer every week, and that was when I was watching *Shiny the Ghost Hunter*. Tonight was not just the season finale, but the culmination of ten long years of gripping story lines and fantastic, sometimes over-the-top (but enjoyably so) acting by some of the most beautiful people ever to grace CBS's stages. Suddenly I thought about the weeks I had remaining down here without the support of this important ritual, and I had to set aside the feeling of dread that rose up for later. Right now was a time for celebration, so I grabbed two beers and walked back to the rec room. Ellen was standing a few feet behind Tyler and Rohan, who were still locked in front of the television. ""Hey guys, change the channel already,"" I said as I handed a beer to Ellen. She cracked it open and took a sip without looking at me. ""You should be thankful we're thousands of miles away from that crap anyway,"" I continued, ""I can't even imagine what Reagan's campaign for a fourth term must be like."" Rohan finally turned around and said, ""Will you shut up Maria? We're on the verge of World War 3 here!"" I looked at Ellen, who finally met my gaze, and scoffed. Three younger students walked in as Rohan was admonishing me. ""Hey Maria! Are you pumped for the finale?"" I didn't interact with this team much, but they usually showed up to watch with me and weren't too annoying. ""You know it!"" I flashed a smile and raised my beer in their direction. They found seats around the television while I said, ""Rohan, the war in Mexico has us all on edge, but we're safe down here. There's no reason it would spread to other regions. If anything, we're safer here than back at the University."" He waved his hand at the television and said, ""What's the point in being safe down here if the world is turned into a nuclear wasteland? Our senile president is announcing that Soviet warships and submarines are crossing the Pacific, and he said they'd be wiped out if they got any closer!"" Tyler turned and added, ""We're really not doing well in Mexico, Maria. It's not like the United States is going to be invaded, but this whole mess that Reagan started to push back against the rise of the Communist Party is spiraling out of control. Who knows if he even has a grip on reality anymore?"" I waved away their concerns. ""Come on guys. The world is still going to be here tomorrow. Now change the channel or get the fuck out of here!"" Tyler handed me the remote and they walked off in the direction of the showers. Reagan was still blathering on about warheads being armed when I switched to one of our two other channels just in time to catch a commercial about car insurance before *Shiny the Ghost Hunter* began. ""Any thoughts on how they'll end it?"" Ellen asked as she sat down next to me. ""Of course, but I'd rather be quiet and find out,"" I winked at her and opened my beer before taking a long, slow pull. The opening credits faded away to a shot of an unlit mine entrance. Faint screams can be heard echoing out as it zooms in, and when it gets close enough we can hear none other than the protagonist herself, Shiny, yelling for help. As the darkness of the mine encompasses the screen, it cuts to a dimly lit shot of her face. She's still screaming. Her perfect white teeth shine faintly, while her tan skin can barely be seen. Suddenly an inky black hand shuts itself around her mouth and pulls her back into the darkness. The next shot is panning over the trees of Shiny's hometown - Sunnyvale - before it cuts to static and a sweaty news anchor appears on the screen. ""Aw come on! What is this horse shit?"" I jump up and beer sloshes out of my can. ""Hey, listen up. Shh!"" Ellen pats my arm and guides me back into my seat. I turn up the television so I can hear the announcement more clearly. ""We are still receiving updating information at this time, but reports are in that the Soviet Union has launched a preemptive strike of nuclear-warhead equipped ICBMs after President Reagan's announcement of a red line in the Pacific. Our experts assure us that if this has happened, the United States will have already responded with nuclear launches of it's own. Targets in the Western United States can expect impact within fifteen minutes, while targets on the East coast may have as long as half an hour before impact. Seek whatever shelter you can immediately. This is not a drill. Nuclear warheads from the Sovi - "" The television cut off. Ellen fainted and fell face-first out of her chair. I looked at the three other students who had gathered to watch *Shiny the Ghost Hunter*. One of the boys threw up, then I chugged the rest of my beer."

"First airline I know of was Lufthansa, with the kit provided by Connexxion by Boeing. I was working on WiFi for a large red UK/international mobile phone company at the time and we were involved in the final parts of the design (unfortunately a bit too late). When CBB went under, the red company did quite a bit of work with Lufthansa and some others to put 3G and WiFi on long-haul aircraft, which would entail chopping a hole in the top of the then new A380. Didn’t actually go anywhere in the end: apparently senior mgmt got cold feet, though the business case seemed sound. Hence the market is rather fragmented at the moment."
"First, how sure are you that the schematic is correct? I own one of these and I'm pretty sure KCD1 is a three-position switch.  It's either for a different model using the same PCB, or you've missed some nets in your schematic.  Having one of these laminators, they are not similar LEDs. One is red and one is green, IIRC. Aside from different colors having different current limits, they also have different visual brightness. The READY LED is also driven through a variable-resistance heating element. I'm sure the lower R-value is due to both of those considerations."
"For all of those who may not follow Eric Sanders on facebook after the Adam Crum incident....A friend of his and fellow south florida rider had a avoidable wreck today. Please pray for him he's still fighting but recovering! [pic](http://i.imgur.com/q48NnE9.jpg) &lt;SFW Ride safe. Rubber side down. Watch for bad drivers. ##**I AM NOT THE ONE WHO CRASHED. THE ONE WHO CRASHED IS MR TEMPLE.**  Info/details: ""Reading everyone's posts and comments now... I'm in tears once again. It's very hard to explain how grateful I am to God that I have once again gone through this and survived. From the paramedics to the trauma nurses, to my family and friends, everyone has been praying so hard... I feel your prayers so much. I'll explain to the best of my ability what happened... Wednesday night I was riding on my girlfriend`s CBR600RR to meet my buddy, Mike, for a little group ride. I never made it. As I turned right onto Congress Ave from Gateway Blvd heading north, a middle-aged woman driving a red Infiniti car was about to take a left turn onto Quantum Lakes Blvd near the L.A. Fitness gym. As I was traveling maybe at 40mph or less in a 45mph zone she decided for whatever reason to just go. (This is the part where excuses and logical reason escaped the situation while selfish, impatient, and completely careless decision making entered.) I was told that I was in the left lane (3 lanes) when she pulled out and my skid marks where only a few feet long, dragging towards the right lane, telling me that I did actually make an attempt to either brake or maneuver around the car, but from my recollection I simply just saw a red car that I was about hit on the side and the only thought I could produce in that limited timing was, ""Ohh s***!"" Then BOOM!! The bike hit the side of the vehicle while I was launched over, but not without my right arm slicing through the glass of the broken window and tearing my muscles and nerves so bad that I've lost most of my motor functions in the entire arm. I also had ribs 6-9 cracked on my right side with a deflated lung, as well as rib 7 cracked on my left side. On top that my liver, spleen, and kidney had massive internal bleeding along with minor cuts and bruises all over my body. The woman was given tickets for failing to yield and causing a life-threatening crash along with a 6-month driving suspension. I will be going to court possibly in a few months to stand with Boynton Beach Police to give a testimony of which I plan on asking for more than a 6-month suspension and raise motorcyclist awareness to the court and request a plan of action from the court to keep my fellow biker buddies safer on the streets, as we all know this is a daily problem which is not going away. Ohh, and by the way my GoPro was on and recording in 1080p superview at 60fps with auto-night mode along with two separate eye-witness accounts. Let me make it well heard - justice will be dished on a cold platter to that woman and she will be made an example of on behalf of all of us riders who have gone down or lost loved ones. To stress even further our 'wonderful' South Floridian community's driving etiquette of which I haven't been much of a fan of lately, as Boynton Beach Police were working on the crash scene a separate woman drove through the closed crash scene completely drunk, almost hit one of the officers, then ran over the wrecked bike. She was taken to jail along with a dirt biker and a motorcyclist who both separately tried to run through the closed crash scene, and I'd really like to know which two toolbags those were so the whole bike community can rise up and keep those two off the road for good. My account of what happened afterwards was so scattered that all I remember was trying to stay calm and begging others to pray for me. In fact, by the time that I was completely conscious, Thanksgiving Day had already passed and it was Friday already with a breathing tube shoved down my throat, which half of the time gave me the feeling of drowning. That woman, in the blink of an eye took zero accountability or responsibility of the fact that because of her poor judgment alone I would begin spending my Thanksgiving holiday fighting for my life. I was wearing my Nexx XR2 full carbon fiber helmet, some mesh\leather gloves, brand new Icon riding shoes with reinforced steel literally fresh out of the box, long Dickies pants, T-shirt, and a brand new backpack... some of the above saved my life. Since October, I have been shopping for an engagement ring for my girlfriend of whom I've spent less than a year together with. I taught her how to ride a motorcycle and have been track riding with her brave soul for a few months now. I decided in the midst of everything going on the past few days that I'd be best just to tell her that I already bought a ring which was hidden at home waiting for Christmas Eve to come around and that I didn't want to wait any longer to ask for her hand in marriage, as I've already seen the proof of what a wonderful woman she is. We are as of recently engaged officially. But, my road to recovery is a long one so please, please keep praying for us. There is a change I've decided to make regarding my life on bikes and obviously is not something that I initially want but need because of the constant carelessness of others... I will no longer ride a motorcycle in the streets. Anyone that knows me well knows that I'd never give up riding. But, for now on I will be riding at the track only and I will be out there as early and as often as I possibly can. God bless all of you for your prayers and may God continue to keep me a loving, humble spirit far passed this situation in a long running life. Adamaris, you are my absolute best friend and I promise to love you, respect you, honor you, support you, and care for you until my very last dying breath on this big, beautiful Earth... — feeling blessed at Delray Medical Center."" -Sean Temple   E: His helmet saved his life with how he crashed....At least wear a helmet guys. :)"
"For the party last weekend I went as Alan Johnson, Unicorn Meat Salesman.

"George Bush built a missile defense shield that is fairly good at stopping ICBMs. Good enough that we don't really have to worry (relatively speaking) about 1, 2, or 12 missiles being launched... they will *probably* be shot down and never reach their targets. But the shield can't possibly stop every single missile in a MAD launch. Only tactical launches. This shield is actually one of the MAJOR reasons Putin is so fucking pissed off about EVERYTHING in Eastern Europe. We brought Poland into NATO, then Bush agreed to put the same missile defense shield in Poland, which between Alaska and other US allies, means that any Russian launch in any direction to any target is likely to be neutralized unless it's a MAD launch, removing Russia's nuclear arsenal as anything but a defensive measure to prevent first launches instead of a saber they can rattle. Turkey is also in NATO and Russia has basically made it clear that there are NO lengths they won't go to in order to prevent a missile shield from being installed in Turkey as well, including using plane strikes to destroy the facilities as they are constructed. It's a giant red line for Moscow. There are not really any hidden anti-ICBM capabilities (I mean... that we know about, which sounds weird) because they would serve no purpose if the other side didn't know about them."
"German engineers knew about the benefits of sloped armor when they designed the Tiger 1. They decided against it because: - they trusted their ""superior"" steel quality (that's a topic on its own) - the 100mm of frontal armor were more than enough to stop enemy rounds at the time even at a 90° angle. The Tiger crews received extensive training to position their tank in a perfect angle to the enemy so that the armor thickness would be optimised. Here is a page in the Tiger 1 handbook, the red dots on the clock represent the optimal location of an enemy tank: http://i.imgur.com/J4d0y.jpg Here is a more detailed graph from the handbook specifically for enemy T-34. Red means the Tiger is safe, green means the Tiger is in danger of being penetrated: http://www.matrixgames.com/forums/upfiles/21246/E29EB6B90C044610843ED409CBB1BB70.jpg If you think the colors red and green are placed quite counter intuitively: it was done so that the danger zone resembled a cloverleaf. Crews were supposed to always keep the enemy out of their cloverleaf. The Tiger can actually penetrate the T-34s armor in all of the red area (smaller red circle for T-34 front and bigger red circle for sides and back). - sloped armor limits the gun size. This is one of the major points against sloped armor. The maximum width of a tank is pretty much fixed because it can't be wider than [the railway system allows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_gauge). So assuming you place the sides of the tank at that maximum width and slope the armor plates inwards. You are now reducing the roof width of the tank. Why is that important? Because the turret ring has to fit between the sides, essentially onto the roof. So by sloping your sides you are reducing your turret ring diameter. And the turret ring size is the greatest factor that determines turret and therefore gun size. You want a big gun, you need a big turret, you need a big turret ring diameter, you need a wide roof. The turret ring diameter actually is what prevented the T-34 from being upgunned even further after the 85mm gun was installed. There were are few more tests with bigger guns, but it was a nightmare for the loader. - sloped armor limits internal space. German tanks had a huge transmission in the front as well as a big radio unit. There was not much space to move this equipment back to allow for a sloped front. Also the space above the tracks (sponsons) were used to store ammunition in. The number of rounds the Tiger could carry would have been severely reduced by sloping the sides. - sloped armor changes the center of gravity. There were tests done with sloped armor on the Panzer IV that revealed that a sloped frontal plate would move the center of gravity even further to the front. THe same issue could be expected for the Tiger. In the end the engineers thought that their approach was good enough and that the disadvantages of sloped armor outweight the advantages.  The Tiger 1 was designed as a breakthrough tank. For mobility the German Amy used the Pz IV and later the Pz V Panther tank. Also at the time the Tiger was designed German economy didn't suffer under shortages as it would later in the war. edit: sorry for not providing any sources apart from the photos. I just can't remember where exactly I read all that. I think you can find most of the crew handbook stuff in the [Tiger-Fibel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigerfibel). Regarding the decisions against sloped armor you would have to use the appropriate book from Jentz &amp; Doyle or Spielberger."
"Greece attacked. Capital was in the red. All tiles pillaged. All units dead, except for a brave composite bowman, a GG, and a worker that was hiding out in my second city. My CB managed to take out the last of Alex's melee units so he couldn't take my city. My second city finished a Spearman which took out his catapults. My worker repaired my mines, pastures and luxury improvements, I sold my luxuries, took out some big loans, and bought some melee units, upgraded my (now highly promoted) comp bowman to a crossbow, churned out some more units, and churned through Alex's cities. He sued for peace, giving me basically all his gold and a couple of luxuries. I sold some more luxuries, and bought a bunch more units. End of the peace treaty, I declared war again and destroyed what remained of his empire. Because fuck Alex."
"Halloween night, 2004. I was the only person with a car big enough for my group and they wanted to go downtown for a friends' party. I said ""sure why not"" and we all piled in. I decided that I was just going to be the sober DD and be all responsible and shit. Party night went off great. I was sober, and had to take my friends home. One decided to crash there. ""J"" was so completely trashed that I had to carry him to my car. ""S"" helped the little she could. We put J into the back seat and he sat straight up, got buckled in and tipped his head back into the window ledge. And we were off. It was about 3am and the streets were pretty empty. As I'm making my way to the freeway I spot a couple police cruisers flying to the west (my left) and think nothing of it. Another 6 blocks and S &amp; I are talking about the night. I'm about a block from the freeway entrance and about to make my final left before the cloverleaf onramp. Red light. A dark colored Chevy Blazer is headed the opposite way down the road I'm currently on. He signals to make the right as if he's going for the onramp too. He has the yellow and I just got the green. I start my turn left, and he decides that he no longer wanted to go to the onramp and turns back in the middle of the crosswalk. It was rainy, my tires were slick, and I had enough momentum to carry my 3000lb car into the drivers side tire of his car. Not enough to cause any damage, and I only hit the tire, no body. I jump out to check on the guy and clearly say ""Are you okay?"". I look at where my car is and realize that his door can't open with my car there. I jump back in, put the car in reverse and back off about 2 feet. Car's in park, and I step back out to see if the guy is alright. I'm barely rounding my front door and the guy is yelling ""What the fuck!"" at the top of his lungs. He's out of the car, in street clothes and pointing a gun at me. My hands were up and I'm repeating ""ARE YOU OKAY?"". The guy yells at me to lay down on the ground in the middle of an intersection and still hasn't identified himself as a cop. My passengers are just as confused as I am, but too drunk to help with a gun-wielding psycho. I roll my head to the side and said ""I was just trying to see if you were okay!"". The guy is holding an old-school style CB handset and talking to someone (the police). Within 5-10 minutes there are 4 police cars in the intersection. Apparently the douche with a gun is an undercover cop. Go figure. There's now 7 cruisers in the road and I'm finally allowed to get up off the ground. No cuffs or anything! They sure were nice. The female officer who was dealing with me is very clearly trying to smell my breath as we talk. I was DD for the night, and I tell her that. I give my recount of the events, and she wrote them down. She walked away to her car and another officer attempts to get my re-retelling of the events. But this guy is a douche. He's talking in circles trying to get me to mess up, he's asking why I drove through a red light, he's all up in my face yelling at me saying ""You know this is your fault"" and just douching the place up. The first officer comes over and tells him to go away. She tells me to sit down in my car, feet outside/door open. As she's stepping away again.. another officer starts walking up to question me. She immediately came over and stated ""I have his story, he's clear, no AOB"" (Alcohol on Breath). She asks me to come over to her car, and so I follow her over. She's checking over all my paperwork and pertinents. The undercover is back in his car and taking off. There was no damage to his car, and I only had a small chunk of my blinker missing. She's saying that they ""have to ticket you(me) for something"". Apparently I was in the wrong because I hit an unmarked police car very illegally trying to make a u-turn out of a freeway onramp. She says the smallest ticket she can find for it is ""Illegal left hand turn"". At this point I'm just happy that they're fucking easing off of me and finally clearing the street. I grab the ticket and ask ""Am I free to go"" (way before it was made cool on youtube) and she's like ""Yeah, go take your friends home"". I start my car up, drive the last 4.7 inches to the onramp and accelerate. I want out of that crappy situation. NOPE. One of the cops has followed me onto the freeway. I got an escort for the ~20 miles home. I don't think he cared if it was out of his jurisdiction. He followed me off the freeway, a couple miles off the exit and then down the dead end street I lived on. I put the car in park and he sat about 200ft up the road from me. Middle of the road, car running, watching. I pull my unconscious friend out of the back seat and throw him over my shoulder. I walked into my apartment building and see him flip a u-turn and peel off. Fuck that night. Fuck the police. ""Innocent until proven guilty"" my ass."
"Having worked somewhat with reference displays... I can start to answer a few questions: 1. What's so good about it, it's using an existing technology... Sort of. Apple didn't outright state that they were using miniLED, but they are -- this thing has 526 LEDs, each with its own dimming zone, which is far higher than the 96 you typically see in these types of monitors, or the 384 zones you see in other miniLED backlight displays, or larger TV's with FALD. **The density of these LED's is unprecedented in the monitor space.** They are also using **blue** LED's rather than white ones, because you can achieve finer control of the light output. Then, there are intermediate layers that direct and diffuse the light, as well as filter it back to ""white"" for the monitor to remain accurate. They are also using one of the best polarizers on the market, and figured out a way to nano texture their glass, to eliminate the rainbowing artifact for a matte screen. Overall, this has many more layers than a traditional LCD panel with LED backlighting. Apple is also using a custom timing controller to handle the image processing, and local dimming, and they are claiming no ""bloom"" / IPS glow -- meaning almost OLED-like black levels. During WWDC they had these monitors in a demo booth next to $25k and $35k reference displays. And they were absolutely on par, as everyone who saw these demos in person said. Furthermore, this monitor has a stunning 219 PPI, where as every other monitor in this space is around 150-160 PPI. A reference monitor is for creating color-accurate content, so that it displays properly on high end screens. Current OLED TV's that are HDR and Dolby Vision ready require people to edit content on monitors that are even better calibrated and capable of displaying even more colors, so the end result looks good on consumer screens. As a result, Reference monitors have extremely stringent QC standards, and Reference Level calibration for a variety of color spaces. Typically, this means a deltaE &lt; 1 (not a typo, less than 1 is quite common for a reference display) for all modes supported. The Apple Pro Display XDR has 9 modes. That alone is an insane feat. Side note: yes, typically dE&lt;2 is ""good enough"", but for color grading, you actually **require** dE &lt;1 (0.5 or better is typical) as **good color graders can spot the difference at dE levels of around 1 or higher.** whereas regular users won't be able to distinguish below a dE of 2. Apple not only calibrates the panel but also EACH of the backlighting miniLEDs, and this calibrating profile is stored in the image processor of each monitor allowing for better prediction of what the final result should look like. Apple also managed to find a way to semi-passively cool this display --that's why there are all these crazy holes in the back. Running so many LEDs at 1000 nits sustained brightness gets VERY hot. That's why this thing is thick, and made of aluminum. Now this may not sound all that impressive, but keep in mind: normal reference monitors have a light on the side that is green when the monitor is at 1000+ nits and changes color to amber or red when the monitor needs to dim itself to cool down. They usually give you 10-20 minutes of working at full color, with *loud fans* and then the display needs to ""rest"" for 10 minutes. Apple is promising 1000 nits ALL the time, with silent cooling, so there is no interruption of work. (there are fans, but Apple says it doesn't get louder than 7dB -- effectively silent because most rooms have a noise floor of 30dB) In terms of resolution, most reference monitors are 4K HDR, by making a 6K display, they let you have editing tools on the *same* screen, rather than moving them to a second monitor. For reference work you need to see each pixel natively - downsampling to 1080p isn't really an option. 2. How are they making money with it, when it that good and costs so much to develop!? Part of it is using proprietary tech. Apple bought a miniLED / microLED display maker, and they're using that tech for the backlight. Apple also has its own display engine and timing controller. They're also not using OLED (which some reference monitors do, but it's insanely expensive) but have configured their LCD reference monitor to be as close to OLED as possible. It also only works with a Thunderbolt 3 enabled computer - most of those are macs, and Apple is expecting to bundle a bunch of these with Mac Pro desktop towers (where their margins are better). So, they'll make their money back with a combination of custom tech (that is cheaper for them to use internally) and vertical integration, as well as selling another product. It's also not as bright as *some* reference monitors. Some reference monitors go up to 2000 nits (3000 peak) brightness. Another thing is that **apple isn't including all the normal controls or inputs you would expect on a reference monitor.** That ""part"" is sold separately, as a Thunderbolt Attachment (since thunderbolt supports daisy chaining), and contains all the industry standard SDI (display interface for broadcast and pro work) inputs and outputs, allowing someone to actually use the Pro Display XDR for color grading / reference work. This stuff is generally including on the PCB of competing displays, but adds even more cost. Apple is skipping that stuff, and letting accessory makers (like Blackmagic Design, which caters to AV pros) make that part, so the system is more modular. So, if I wanted to use this monitor for color grading... I would want to grab [this $1250 add-on](https://www.tvtechnology.com/the-wire-blog/bmd-teranex-mini-sdi-displayport-8k-hdr) so I could integrate it with other SDI equipment and broadcast-grade gear, and use LUTs (look up tables) for color grading.  So by skipping out on all these features, apple can lower the price of these displays. Keep in mind this is pro gear, and its modular and you buy what you need with it -- so the $1k stand, and this $1.2k add-on is basically a drop in the bucket for a studio that wants to use these."
"He doesn't seem to understand the difference between objective and subjective. Body shape or appearance attractiveness will always be subjective no matter what, meaning that there is no fixed definition of ""this is attractive"" or ""this is unattractive"". For your boyfriend to say that is a major red flag. A good partner brings us up when we are down and makes us feel loved when we feel unworthy. I feel he isn't doing either. I don't know enough about your relationship to comment on it, but I hope that these comments aren't a typical thing from him. It's one thing to say ""I like these types of boobs"". It's another to say ""your boobs are flawed"". I hope that this is a happy relationship outside of that. I hate to draw attention, but given your username I hope it's appropriate. Based on your post history it's clear that you aren't happy with your own apperance. You ask how do you move on from this? You're not finding acceptance from strangers on the internet and you're not finding acceptance from your partner. You need to work out how to accept yourself without validation from other people. If you have Body Dysmorphia then obviously it's so much harder than my sentence implies, but that's the blunt reality. Perhaps it might be through therapy, maybe CBT. The negative comments you have received (including from your partner) seem to be playing a big part of your self perception which is why CBT might be helpful."
"He wasn't shit at all. People's judgement got clouded after that ridiculous red card vs City. Overall, he's our best CB by a country mile."
"Here's my stats: https://i.imgur.com/ZcvXvQe.png I used my RCB and broad bolts, diamond bolts (e) for jad, full black dhide, nezzy helm, rune kite, ava's accumulator, barrows gloves, glory and climbing boots. Explorer's ring for the run energy at the beginning of the caves. I intended to take verac skirt but I forgot it until I was 40 waves in. My inventory was 5 karambwan, 250 diamond bolts (e), mystic legs, rune pouch with blood blitz runes in it, and the rest prayer pots. I had about 4 pray pots left over (this was mostly due to my fairly low ranged, being off task, etc), used around 800 broads, 100 diamond bolts. I had plenty of food, but got a couple of bad spawns/misplays by running under the lvl 360s, not realizing they will melee, and taking a couple of smacks from the 180s too. I ended up blood blitzing most mobs if I was missing health, it hit pretty easily on everything except the 360s. I didn't need my mystic legs but I took it just in case, and having ancient staff for positive magic attack bonus is good. I used the west-side safespot, some call it long rock? You can safespot along the south side of the long rock (pictured here https://i.imgur.com/BZai0QT.png) When you're in later ranging/melee waves, you can run to the white dot to pull the mob close enough to keep a melee safespotted at the red dot and fire over the top of them. This rock only has one safespot however at the red dot, and not along the ""inside"" east wall like Italy has. I know a lot of people use Italy rock but imo having the single safespot was enough and less confusing to think about. Also, since there's a spawn in the southwest corner sometimes you're able to kill things without leaving the safespot or before the rest of the spawns crash in. This was my 3rd attempt, first time I didn't focus rangers on 180 + 90 waves, so I got smashed. Second I died to Jad with 1 healer left, missed a flick. My Jad strat was to listen for the ""double boom"" sound when Jad mages, and then recognize the quick ground pound for his ranged attack. I messed around with the ""back foot"" strategy, but I didn't really need that. Also I used this video to practice flicks in my head, covering up the prayer interface and speaking my flicks aloud :) https://youtu.be/hsEkoRqR-wo I just stopped around wave 60 and spent 5 minutes or so ""practicing"" Let me know if anyone needs help with the fight caves, and big ups to the overflow cc (aka main cc) for the support when the first two tries went belly up."

"Hey guys! This is my write-up for the series most of you have seen on /r/nfl. We're coming up soon, so I just wanted to run this by the fans and see what you think. I'm open to suggestions/minor edits/comments/critiques/cheese coneys: Team: [](/CIN)**Cincinnati Bengals** -------- Record: 10-5-1 Division: AFC North | 2nd in AFC North (3-3 in Division)  Coach: Marvin Lewis Offensive Coordinator: Hue Jackson Defensive Coordinator: Paul Guenther ----------- **Statistics** ======== Category | Total | Average Per Game | League Rank | ---- | Category | Total | Average Per Game | League Rank ---|---|----|----|----|----|---|---|----|----|----|---- **Offensive** Yards |5568|303.7|15th|----|**Defensive** Yards Allowed|5749|373|22nd Passing Yards|3421|213.3|21st|----|Pass Yards Allowed|3888|235.8|20th Rushing Yards|2147|90.4|6th|----|Rush Yards Allowed|1861|137.2|20th Points|365|15.9|15th|----|Points Allowed|344|27.4|12th Interceptions Thrown|17|1.17|24th|----|Interceptions|20|1.25|3rd Touchdowns|26|1.8|29th|----|Touchdowns Allowed|45|2.8|30th Giveaways|26|1.8|21st|----|Takeaways|16|1|29th **Summary:** This is a team that was unremarkable in terms of point and yardage differential, but which managed to win a lot of games anyway. We could point to blowout losses weighed against close victories to explain all this, but the team did have its own blowout wins (@Cleveland Fighting Johnnies, vs. TEN, @NO), and some of the losses were closer than the scoreboard indicated (both PIT games). Bottom line: This was a weird team, and we'll need more than summary statistics to explain what went right and what went wrong. ------------ **General (2014-2015 Recap)** ========= **2014 Offseason** * The Cincinnati Bengals lost both major assistant coaches following the 2013 season, with OC Jay Gruden taking the head coaching gig in Washington, and beloved DC Mike Zimmer doing the same in Minnesota. Hue Jackson and Paul Guenther were hired from within as replacements. * Andy Dalton was signed to what appeared at first to be a massive contract extension. Under further review, most of the potential money is tied up in bonuses and incentives, but this was a major signal that the ~~Bengals' front office~~ Brown family is confident in the red-headed media lightning rod. * The Bengals were quiet (even for the Bengals) during free agency. The team allowed OT Anthony Collins and DE Michael Johnson to get big contracts in Tampa Bay, while restricted free agent and fan favorite WR Andrew Hawkins got an offer from Cleveland. The Bengals didn't match the offer, and Hawkins signed with the cross-state rival. Cincinnati felt the loss of each of these players throughout the 2014 season. 2014 Draft Pick | Player (Position) | Recap -------|--------|---- 24| Darqueze Dennard (CB, Michigan St.) | There's a common debate over the merits of drafting for need vs. drafting the best player available. It helps when one player fills both. Cincinnati was in need of a young DB, but they reportedly had Dennard listed at 8th on their big board anyway. This was an easy call at No. 24. 55 | Jeremy Hill (RB, LSU) | For the second consecutive year, Cincinnati drafted a running back in the second round. Hill was brought in to add a prototypical brusing runner to pair with 2013 rookie speedster Giovani Bernard. 88 | Will Clarke (DE, West Virginia) | Clarke is physically gifted, but was drafted as a project in the third round. Not much is known yet about his ability to produce at the pro level. 111 | Russell Bodine (C, North Carolina) | In an *extremely* rare and surprising move, the Bengals traded up in the draft. They landed Bodine, who was almost immediately tagged to be the starting center for 2014. He has some more development to do, but he's a decent player. 164 | A.J. McCarron (QB, Alabama) | The NFL draft media predictably had a field day with such a consistent collegiate winner being drafted by the Bengals, who are often thought to be stuck in mediocrity at the quarterback position. But Andy Dalton was nearly just as successful in college in terms of win percentage. McCarron is a backup until actual evidence suggests otherwise. 212| Marquis Flowers (OLB, Arizona) | Some didn't see Flowers as a draftable prospect, but the Bengals grabbed him in round 6. Was able to get some regular season snaps on defense. 239| James Wright (WR, LSU) | One of the pleasant surprises of this draft, Wright was a minor contributer when the team found itself in a tight spot in the wake of several WR injuries. Not bad for a seventh-round rookie. 212| Lavelle Westbrooks (CB, Georgia Southern) | Westbrooks failed to make the 53-man roster  ------------ **Season Summary** * Preseason general notes: The feeling during preseason was that this was a championship-caliber team. Jay Gruden was “lost” to the Redskins in the offseason, and sadly, Mike Zimmer became head coach of the Vikings. The defensive unit now faced questions under new leadership and lost personnel. Hue Jackson made a lot of fans happy with an offensive plan that seemed geared towards a more well-rounded offense. Ravens (W) – Great season start. We dominated defensively and Hue Jackson showed quite a change of pace in offense design. Dalton to Green is unquestionably the play of the game. Tyler Eifert goes down with a dislocated elbow, and while initially designated to return, it will be the end of his season. Vontaze Burfict goes down with a concussion. This theme, unfortunately, continues later. Falcons (W) – Can we copy and paste this team into every game? All phases won, and won big. Giovanni Bernard has a classic Gio game (:3), and Jeremy Hill scores his first touchdown. Mohammed Sanu throws an absolute bomb of a TD pass to a double-covered Brandon Tate. The defense dominated. Burfict goes down again with a concussion. Storm clouds begin to gather, but DOESN’T MATTER BENGALS WON. Titans (W) – This game we dominated and everyone was aboard the Bengals hype train. Sanu threw a touchdown pass to Andy Dalton! Bernard ran in 2 touchdowns! Hill ran one in too! After this week, everyone thought the Bengals were pretty much invincible, until… Bye Patriots (L) – Under the bright lights, we folded, and The Patriots showed up. The best thing said about the offense that game was that Andy Dalton wasn’t terrible. The less said about the porous defense, the better. The Patriots had a lot to prove coming into the game, and they certainly proved it. Panthers (T) – A nailbiter that went into overtime, forcing the league’s only iie of the year, after Mike Nugent missed a 36 yard field goal on the final play of the game. A.J. Green was inactive for the game, but Sanu was a leader on offense, along with a fantastic 89 yard run by Bernard. Colts (L) – In what was one of many notable low points of the season, the Colts shut out the Bengals 27-0. The most that can be said about the defense is that Carlos Dunlap played a solid game. In game recaps, Huber’s punting ability was noteworthy, if for no other reason that there were simply so many other negatives. There was simply put no positive news on offense this game. Ravens (W) – A good game to bounce back from the absolute assault from the Colts. Bernard and Burfict went down with injuries, Bernard would eventually make his return and pave the way for Hill later in the season. The Ravens tried to come back with a last minute drive, but a OPI call on Steve Smith brought the Ravens late momentum to a halt. Jaguars (W) – The Hill legend was born in this game. 153 yards, 2 touchdowns, and let’s not forget about Sanu. It was a great showing by the Bengals if somewhat sloppy. Browns (L) – Thursday night prime time game that ended up being a nightmare. Perhaps Dalton’s worst showing of the season, not even clearing 75 yards passing, the offense simply could not get a rhythm or anything approaching it going. The most positive thing to come out of the game was the presentation of the check for over $1 million to brave Leah Still for pediatric cancer research. Saints (W) – Beginning a 3-game road stretch, The Bengals looked dominant. Dalton led the offense to a 3 TD passing performance and another 150+ yard game from Jeremy Hill. The goal line stand in the 2nd quarter was a reminder of the talent on the defense, even with the injuries throughout the year. Texans (W) – A.J. Green had a career-high 12 receptions in a win at Houston. J.J. Watt was mostly successfully contained and the defense played a solid game against Ryan Mallett. The defense racked up its third safety of the year. Buccaneers (W) – In what was otherwise a poor showing, the Bengals managed to eek out a win on the heels of a not-officially-sanctioned challenge flag. Marvin Lewis flashed some brilliance by calling out a 12 men penalty on the Buccaneers, halting their final drive and destroying their momentum. Dalton threw 3 picks and there weren’t really any offensive leaders, but somehow they hung on for the win. Steelers (L) – The Bengals kept this game competitive until the 4th quarter, when the Steelers offense steamrolled the Bengals with 24 unanswered points. Dalton put up among his best numbers of the season, over 300 yards passing with 2 touchdowns; unfortunately the defense simply eroded in the 4th quarter. Le’Veon Bell was a terror in this game. Browns (W) – In what was a big headline game all week. Johnny Manziel made his professional debut against the most dominant performance by the Bengals defense of the season. Hill again ran a dominant game with 148 yards and 2 touchdowns. The defense showed up, completely shutting out the Browns, redeeming the awful week 10 showing. Broncos (W) – With a playoff berth on the line, the Bengals as a whole played their best game of the season. The defense was able to intercept Manning a total of 4 times, with a big kudos to Dre Kirkpatrick. Hill again dominated in the rushing game with 147 yards and 1 touchdown. Steelers (L) – The AFC North champion would be crowned in this game, and as good as the Bengals looked against the Broncos, the same team did not make the trip to Pittsburgh. Dalton threw for 243 yards, but was intercepted twice, halting offensive momentum. Even the steady Green racked up a rare fumble, on clearly what was not the Bengals best performance. Hill again put in a solid performance with another 100 yard game. The Steelers made more plays, and the Bengals were forced to accept a wild card spot, meaning they’d travel to Indianapolis for Week 18. ------------ Continued in comments"
"Hi All - I'm a new rider (but old as dirt at 27). I'm taking the basic skills class the 2nd week of June, but was advised from a thread I made over at /r/motorcycles to look at buying a bike now before the Summer hits. I found a bike (the Craigslist post has since been removed since he knows I'm interested) in New Lenox. It's a 2014 CBR650f that *looks* fine, and the guy actually talks like a normal human being through texting. My issue is that I don't really know anyone who rides outside of one guy, and I wouldn't know 100% what to look for when checking it out. Soooo....and I know it's a long shot.....would anyone be willing to come check out this bike to give me the red or green light? I'd certainly be willing to compensate for your time with a few bucks/beer/lunch/whatever. For what it's worth I'm up in Lombard...."
"Hi everybody, so long story short, my team lost last weekend and I went out drinking. The next day I woke up to a nice white/red/blue OCBD partially covered in puke. I have since learned my lesson and will just go out in a t shirt or something that I wont mind ruining. Any suggestions for cleaning the puke out?"
"Hi friend! No, 16 is not excessive - not at all :) For reference, here is a [link](https://kirkmcdonald.github.io/calc.html#zip=dZJhagQhDIVv468VZndoC1M8jKvZmVCNkkRoe/o6LbvUMgUR8z6N8ZmM5GZza5ActZDAs90Dc4WkDt4rg4hV9iS1sNpdNrlyie7yMpmYXZ1NvDrZ5+DOzwYVsjgJCBTAVh/e7Hnh5WmaptOgXg7V+a5mTKieP+xvfId7AS0oFjrEG66bVQjbIZUewBExuWdNIM6H0HJLXgsvMj/GCRIEZQzdIqae5BhmJKTVRsaUhh035O5vttmv/hNpPL4ykI9/tEZWGzPoICMJsMJYW0XgsN/LpVGU40sq1lFgH/2YR7xC6taP+6Sk3hnVE4xPkgoQ7Y9vAxhbZkCh1ApsC8NCrVv0mF6/V9MJuf/rv/gL) to what I'm in the middle of building: 5 rockets per minute = 5000 science per minute. Highlights: 270% mining productivity (Level 130) means my miners make 2.6 bonus ore for every ore mined, which massively reduces miner requirements: ""Only"" 4064 miners for iron, and 2107 for copper. 4064 miners will fill 197 blue belts of iron, which is obviously not possible. So we direct insert everything: Mine straight into train cars, drive 5-10 trains from the mines over to the smelters, unload directly to furnaces, load directly to train cars on the other side, then drive to green chip and direct unload again. Everything is beaconed and loaded with productivity modules. A rocket silo, even with a lot of speed beacons, is too slow to keep up, so we need **eight** rocket silos continuously making rocket parts. At full power, we should be launching a rocket every 12 seconds. Right now we're just under half power, so it's a rocket every 30 seconds or so. We had to walk quite a ways away from the orgin to find big enough iron patches. Once we got out 3000+ blocks away, we started finding patches over 100M. About 5000 blocks out we found our best patch yet: 535 million iron. We managed to put about 700 miners on that patch alone, and it should last us a while :). Other nonsense that gave us trouble: You'll need 13 pipes of water just for the refinery, and 10 pipes of crude oil. Due to how glitchy fluid mechanics are in 0.16, you'll need to connect every pipe to a pump to keep enough flow rate. It's a lot of pumps. The biggest construction of anything in the entire factory is red chips: You'll need 600 assemblers, consuming 27 blue belts of green chips, 27 belts of plastic, and 54 belts of cables (or direct insert those; bless our soul). Power is also a concern: We have two &gt;10 GW nuclear plants, but the UPS hit was getting pretty bad, so we're trying to replace them all with Solar, and feed the growing factory at the same time. So far we've blueprinted 13 GW of solar, but we don't use any less nuclear: We're just up to 34 GW peak power consumption. We'll need more solar panel assemblers to keep up, which require more power and more steel, so the factory grows..."
"Higher colored master points don't count towards meeting lower color requirements.  CLUB MASTER – a member who has at least 20 masterpoints recorded by ACBL, of which 5 must be black. I have 30+ master points in total ~15 are silver/red/gold, but only 3.25 are black (and the remainder was online). So I have no title at all. :-D I realize most players have the opposite problem -- I just thought it was funny."
"Hmm... While it does make complete sense for it to be a greatsword, I have to agree with this other guy who said it should be a Charge blade. The Moonlight gs is famous for the shock wave slam, and the charge blade is perfect for that. It could function like the Dante CB, where the blade transforms instead of expands, and for the SAED it releases a blue moonlight wave. However... I could see it being a greatsword because of the TCS. Maybe for fighting a regular Ludwig you get the Moonlight GS which when you charge, it pulses with moonlight energy (dragon). Then, when you do a true charged slash, if you charge up a special (you know how it zooms in with streaks of red around the corners, and on the second hit you get a much higher damage number?) it does a massive amount of (moonlight) dragon damage. THEN, for fighting a Tempered Ludwig, you get tickets to upgrade it to the Moonlight GS+, which not only does more damage, has higher affinity, sharpness, an additional deco slot, BUT on the second hit of the True charged slash, you launch a blast of moonlight energy (dragon energy) forward. What do you think?"
"Honestly, I feel like it was on the verge of being perfect but all they needed was a infinite invasion item. In addition maybe players who did not pledge to any covenant could have a 50% chance of getting sent protection when invaded. The only reason the Sent/WoB/BloodBro balance was so fucked is because it was easier to farm cracked blue eye orbs meaning more people went sent, this meant fewer invaders sinning, too many Sents looking to invade sinners, and very very veeeery few red invaders which in turn naturally makes WoB meaningless. All they had to do was make the Sents have to farm CBEO's, give bloods and infinite invasion item and the balances would have sorted themselves out."
"Hopefully Cook has been studying the whole time, and he'll gel better with Rodgers (they seemed to be getting more used to each other before his injury). If the offense can be more efficient on 3rd down and in the red zone with a good TE target to threaten LB's/safeties, then perhaps we can at least compete in a shootout better even if our CB-less defense can't stop it."
"How red? Mine usually go a little darker than when they're unrestrained, but really dark red/purple probably isn't good. Erections shouldn't be pleasant - the whole point is to stop you from being able to have them. It generally feels very tight on the shaft of the penis from it pressing against the cage/tube, and can cause the cage to pull away from your body and yank on your balls. As long as the discomfort subsides when you stop trying to get hard, it should be fine. On the other hand, if the extra pressure/pulling/friction has caused you broken skin or other injury, it's a problem. Cleaning inside the cage... is really difficult. I do my best with a removable shower head and plastic-handled cotton swabs and hot soapy water but honestly, if the cage is a closed design (holy trainer, CB3000/6000, etc) you really need to come out of it for a thorough wash at *least* weekly (a lot of people in these devices take it off for cleaning daily). Open designs with bars and lots of space between the bars are much easier to clean, since you can get at virtually any part inside the cage for cleaning."
"I’d argue that the reason we had an atrocious defense in 14-15 was more on not finding a steady CB partner to Vertonghen than anything else. Fazio has a stretch of maybe 10 matches where he was solid, whereas otherwise he was way too slow to play the high-line we wanted. Dier was better but not experienced enough, and normally used at RB after Naughton left anyways. Chiriches was a disaster, red card waiting to happen (Stoke 3-0 Spurs). Kaboul was on his last legs. The Mason - Bentaleb double pivot didn’t offer a lot of defensive stability, but I think you’re overselling their role in our defensive fragility that season."
"I’m pretty sure the PCB board is all fucky in the OCD, and someone said they jacks are mounted to the PCB. But even if I decided to strip and repaint it I have literally nothing to do that, so the end costs will end up being about the same as just buying a Tumnus, but the Tumnus will include a lot less headache and look better. And also doesn’t have a red LED which I’m biased against. I’m constantly tempted to learn to solder just to replace all the red LEDs I’m stuck with."
"I Iove this phone (H815) but I also kinda hate it. Back in October last year I had some overheating, lag and just general shitty problems, Phone got sent to LGUK for warranty repair, got returned with a new battery. Then on Christmas Eve I got the bootloop. Again, phone was sent to LG UK where it stayed for a month, before chiming back with a new PCB. The day after it was returned they admitted that the phones are defective. Now I've got this: [LCD Image Retention](http://i.imgur.com/6IG1BdA.jpg). Anything white stays in the screen, whether it's the status icons, navigation buttons, or even ""card"" margins, I get a red tinge wherever there was white. Despite being the best phone I've ever owned, it's also the worst. I've tried reaching out to @LGUK on twitter for comment, but to no avail."
"I agree, but just to play devil's advocate, the Panthers rolled out 2 rookie CBs, so it was disappointing to not see DT capitalize in a big way. That red zone drop hurt too. Then again, CAR was bringing pressure, so Siemien didn't have time to exploit those rookie corners"
"I also have freckles and auburn (brown/red) hair. I find good colors for me are: * Olive * Navy * Forest Green * Lavender * Gray * Brown  Mostly neutrals (less chromatic). This can be light neutrals like the typical OCBD blue (oxford cloth button down) to dark neutrals like a Navy. Nothing too vibrant like fire engine red or royal blue. As for fit, I am 5'6"" 130 lbs. So I have to find places that sell XS sweaters. This leaves me with not many options. I buy lots of v-neck [Merino wool sweaters from Express](http://www.express.com/italian-merino-wool-v-neck-sweater-38708-60/control/show/3/index.pro) because they sell them in XS. I get them on sale or with coupons. Don't buy them full price. I also get lots of sweaters (or more specifically, cardigans) from H&amp;M. They also sell XS. But if you are not limited by size there are plenty of options for you. I prefer my sweater to fit snug over the top of my button up shirts. It's more comfortable for me and I think it looks better. Take a look at the pictures on the [Express Merino Sweater](http://www.express.com/italian-merino-wool-v-neck-sweater-38708-60/control/show/3/index.pro) page as an example of how I like the sweaters to fit."
"I can't see anything too obvious in the photos, apart from the inner cores being sliced. That really shouldn't happen. If you can't see any copper though it should do much. When you say the power went out, do you know what tripped? Was it an RCD only, a circuit breaker or a RCBO (combination of both)? Did the power supplying the power point you were using go out our the whole apartment? If you are going to try it again I would remove the red/black cable from the power supply first. That way you're eliminating a variable. If it still happens then it wasn't that cable. As for whether or not you will trip something again the are no guarantees. Yes using a power board with overload protection and a plug in RCD like the one you linked together will be about as much as you can reduce your risk of tripping something in the switchboard but it is still a possibility depending on what type of fault is causing the trip. It is impossible to say exactly what type of fault it is with the information you've given. Chances your PSU is now blown are high. It may have been bad from the start (if you got it from AliExpress that chance is much higher). Knowing what tripped can help considerably in diagnosing."
"I did soccer Zlatan Ibrahimovic - QB, would have a rocket arm and a ton of confidence Mesut Ozil - QB, smart, accurate, great footwork Neymar - CB, fluid and quick as hell. All pro talent. Ronaldo - FS, Ball hawk. Speed and play making instincts. Size to punish receivers. Messi - RB, Sproles but better Marco Reus - Slot receiver, quick and elusive Gareth Bale - Running back, speed. home run threat every carry. Charles/Peterson hybrid. Arturo Vidal - Rover, tough with a nose for the ball. David Alaba - CB, you're not running past this guy, shut down corner but doesn't get many picks. Angel Di Maria - CB, fluid hips, great feet. Ball hawk. Vincent Kompany - TE, huge threat up the seam with speed and size. Ton of red zone TDs, wins every jump ball, tough and technical blocker Karim Benzema - WR, great routes, soft hands, and huge red zone threat Paul Pogba - SS, big, rangy, and ready to lay the wood Franck Ribery - Slot receiver. YAC nightmare. A quicker, faster, more elusive Welker with a knack for getting open. Sergio Ramos - OLB. Runs sideline to sideline reliable against the run and in coverage. Has issues if you run right at him."
"I don't know it was fake. I know that the salad man recorded it.  I didn't say ""it doesn't matter it was fake."" If it's fake, it's fake, and I'd like to know that it's fake *if* it's fake. I don't need to pile up make-believe shit onto the real shit Antifa really does.  Nah, Antifa actually [blasted a woman in the face](https://youtu.be/PG5cl6ov_2g) with pepper spray because they thought her red hat was a MAGA hat. It wasn't a MAGA hat. Or the time that Antifa showed up to a peaceful demonstration in Boston because they thought it was a white power rally. It wasn't. [It was these people.](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/APgvz0RSX7M/maxresdefault.jpg) Draw your attention to the BLM signs. Then a bunch of Antifa got arrested for fighting, despite no Nazis being in attendence. Or the time [Antifa attacked a CBS reporter](http://i.imgur.com/YzYaXfw.png) because he didn't flash press credentials. Or when they [shot fireworks at an MLK building.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/01/milo-yiannopoulos-uc-berkeley-event-cancelled) Even the [SPLC](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/southern-poverty-law-center-condemns-antifa-but-wont-call-hate-group/article/2633252) hates them. I don't need to make up shit about them. All this that stuff I just dropped is real unless Salads is a Bloefeld-tier diabolical mastermind. I just [see the pattern](https://youtu.be/qW2XvNR5Xmo) and come to expect this kind of shit."
"I don't see the problem with a blue PCB, but I have a blue themed build. Or at least I did until I ended up buying a graphics card with a red shroud that I keep telling myself is only temporary. That 24pin though, ugh."
"I don't think there is that big of an issue with IB drops, when the rolls for the vendor are that awesome I really didn't mind not having a sniper or launcher drop. I did have the exclusive gauntlets drop (309), I also played far less than your 300 (maybe 80-100). RNG is just that RANDOM. I do like your suggestions for making the level 3 package relevant. With 3oC though I was able to infuse both my launcher and sniper to 310 without touching any of my weapons when I started so I could in essence say they dropped (i did after all get enough marks through bounties to attain them). IB drops shouldn't be to high since, while it is a week long activity, it does happen regularly unlike the one time only srl, comparing the two is unrealistic. Finally the rank 5 package is typically greater that gold tier bounty reward in trials of osiris (I say typically as I know some people get crap rank 5 drops but they have always always always been better for me and everyone I play with than gold tier bounties). They are both also obtainable in about the same amount of time if you play on monday.  Your biggest point though about the CBMM and SBMM is clearly broken. Its so broken it would be better if they straight up randomized everything. Going up against a 6 man team of red barring 2k elo's? Just quit and report them. The more reporting hopefully the less problems. Plus, you have the confidence that for every group like that you get crushed by you will also get to face the 3 year olds playing on mommy and daddy's accounts that you in turn abuse like a rental car."
"I got some exactly like that a few weeks ago. I'm saving them for the warmer months. Best with a blue OCBD and loafers. But still there are lots of options. And if worse comes to worst and you can't figure out a practical way to mix them into your every day wardrobe, you can save them for the 4th of July or maybe Christmas with a Green Merino V-Neck. Really rock those red pants."
"I have a heavy one I got in Ireland that had the burgee of the yacht club where I sailed. It’s one of my favorite fucking pieces of clothing in the world. It’s not rugby striped, rather it’s heavy navy blue with a white collar and placket, with the red and gold burgee on the chest. It’s really at its best when I throw it on over an OCBD or polo to layer in the fall. But yeah they’re awesome."
"I have the best [hair color](http://i.imgur.com/E4UtnOV.jpg) I could have ever asked for. It's a [glorious, beautiful mix](http://i.imgur.com/IjCBSJ3.png) of red, brown, auburn, and chestnut. I've gotten several compliments on [it](http://i.imgur.com/10ajNS0.jpg) from other people over the years. I love [it](http://i.imgur.com/KbbSSs2.png)!"
"I keep a short list of things that I'd like to buy in the future: Green OCBD, red shorts, brown shorts. This keeps me from buying anything unnecessary (stuff on sale). I usually look around online a couple times a week. I follow /r/frugalmalefashion. I'll buy stuff about once a month, when I can find an appropriate sale."
"I know this is a state by state thing and I'm not sure if there's a better sub for it, but in my case smoking is integral to my ability to hold a job. I didn't start smoking until it was decriminalized in my state (Vermont) and prior to this I could not hold a job. I'm a college graduate but I'd work menial jobs washing dishes or mopping floors until I'd inevitably get fired, then start over. I couldn't sleep for more than 2 hours straight without help and most of that help came from mixing alcohol and benzos. Eventually after one too many violent outbursts under the influence of both, my girlfriend got me to try weed despite my protests of ""but that's illegal"". Worked flawlessly. It's incredible how many mental issues can be completely cured by having a good night's sleep. I've been smoking every night for the past year and a half and in that time have been able to finally pursue the field I went to college for, and I've had the same job for seven months without issue. In about five weeks I'm moving to a decriminalized city (this move is mostly outside my control) in a very red state where inside city limits anything above a quarter is a felony, and outside city limits having a joint on you means prison time. I have friends there who say it's not as big of a deal as the news makes it sound but every day I hear about weed arrests. I'm worried about what may happen if I need to go back to my old way of doing things. What exactly do I need to know to get treatment? CBD helps me to be able to cope during the day but it's not strong enough to help me sleep. When I have bronchitis or can't smoke due to other sickness I get myself to sleep alternating shots of whiskey and ZZZQuil but I wake up sick and I don't want to have to do this every night."
"I like a tasty sativa with a low to medium CBD level. Even a regular indica makes me to apathetic and spacey to function normally, and sativas have enough CBD to help my anxiety and insomnia. I plan on getting a vape (or two) and a red card this summer, so we'll see how that goes."
"I mean, artistic is not always related to best production honestly. But i would say that overall, Big Hit has always had a clear intention with their MVs both for BTS and TXT with their theme on the corruption of youth, and doing it in so many ways instead of regular stuff like: ""Oh no he sad so he does drugs"", a great example of this are Blood, Sweat and Tears (Japanese version) and Runaway by TXT. Monsta X since Dramarama has had a solid world (even tho they don't always know how to connect everything), even using real life theories about time and space to create some of their sci fi time travel stuff, even working on it on their Japanese releases. And they also have a really particular sound that no one else does, and when someone else has tried something similar is just not the same magic. Dreamcatcher puts really well tought stuff even tho you can tell that sometimes the budget is not enough, but overall it works pretty well even if you (like me) your are not a super fan trying to catch every single connection. Then SM has really good producers (even tho some of them have quite of a, let's say, not specially mature attitude), that are constantly pushing boundries in terms of sound design and riding trends. For example, Red Velvet's red flavor has a pretty distinct vocal lead/synth. EXO-CBX really takes you into that retro(?) vibe without making it feel out of place."
"I once had a CB get a red card, get back from suspension and since my CB depth is less than a kid's pool, I start him again, five minutes later he was red carded."
"I only watched the first episode. I guess my impressions could best be described as 'mixed'. It looks like the reboot series, which doesn't really do anything for me, but fans of the reboot series should like it. It had their weird dichotomy of being very serious about things, but then being super comical/unrealistic at the same time. An example is how the klingons were all portrayed very seriously, they have some kind of plan to lure the federation into war in order to unite all the houses, but then the way they choose the next herald or w/e is some lower class guy comes up and burns his hand (to what should realistically be useless) to prove his worth and so they pick him. So the first part is something I'd expect in a serious reboot that was tightly plotted, realistic, and heavy with drama. And the second part is something I'd expect from the cheesier TOS era. Another example is how they make a point of showing the 2nd in command Michael has been really good, worked under the captain for something like 7 years, and she is now ready for her own command. Then she disobeys orders left and right, assaults her captain, stages a mutiny, and acts generally unstable. Why has that never come up in the last 7 years? That's borderline Manchurian Candidate stuff here. How did that never come up in starfleet evals? I mean, I'm assuming they're plotting some longer emotional arc for the character, but the way it was done in the first episode seemed schizophrenic. I had years to get to know Picard, so when he has crazy moments like in Best of Both Worlds or First Contact, it seems out of character, and I can understand it. With several character flips in 40 minutes I don't know what to think other than I don't like the writers. Most of the actors seemed pretty good though. Doug Jones and his character nailed it, Michelle Yeoh was great, Daft Punk was a nice surprise. I guess a lot of the rest of the stuff I didn't like were little things that broke canon, seemed like bad writing, or seemed unsuited for the 'dark, serious, and dramatic' tone the show seemed to be going for. Holograms walking around a room and sitting on/interacting with things the can't see from their POV? And for that matter, running off in the middle of a red alert to call up your dad for advice? Shuttles that can't fly in asteroid fields? Accidentally killing a klingon in a space suit when they all seem to wear giant chest armor plates on the ships? The old, scrambled suit cam footage trick? I ended up giving a 6/10. I was waffling between a 5/10 and a 6/10 and ended up on 6/10. It's got some promise, but it didn't exactly motivate me to fork over the money for CBS's streaming service. Also, wtf is with the end of the episode, it just ends abruptly... no 'To Be Continued' or anything. I had no idea if it was going to be a 2 part 1st episode like TNG/DS9/VOY/ENT or if it's just going to be one really long story broken up into 15 parts."
"I see your point. He should keep it to Wenger and himself. I just think its whatever, at the end of the day we still have Bellerin. I'll always remember that red card against Besiktas, and he had a good performance at CB against Man U(?)"
"I was just thinking about this. I actually probably wouldn't go totally crazy, I'd just build a simple, high (but not too expensive) quality wardrobe. Tops: * Mercer and Sons OCBDs in blue, white and pink. * J. Press Shaggy Dog sweaters in a few colors, grey, red, green, navy. * Some MTM dress shirts, not sure where from. * A loopwheeled crew neck sweatshirt, maybe Real McCoys. * An assortment of J Crew Polo Shirts (navy, white, maroon, grey); prefer those to PRL and don't really see any need to buy anything nicer than that. * Probably a few ridiculous looking Hawaiian shirts. Bottoms: * Epaulet Rivet chinos in khaki, olive, navy, grey, and duck canvas. * Epaulet Walt Trousers, wool. * A pair of LVC 1954 501Z, but I could be convinced to go with some nicer Japanese raws. * J Crew chino shorts in navy, olive, grey, and khaki. Again, don't really see the need to get nicer shorts than that. Suits and shit: * BB 1818 Fitzgerald navy blazer. * BB 1818 Fitzgerald suit in black, grey, and navy. * A midnight blue, shawl collar, one button tuxedo. * Bunch of BB Rep Stripe ties. * Or maybe all bespoke. Not sure where the best place to have that done. Obviously Savile Row, but I'd rather the suits be styled more on the American side of things. Outerwear: * MTM raw selvedge Type III Trucker * Maroon Barracuta G9 * Some kind of nice peacoat Shoes: * Rancourt camp mocs * Rancourt beefroll loafers * Rancourt Blake chukkas * Viberg Service boots * CP Achilles lows, white. * CP Achilles Retro, white w/gumsole * Black AE park ave's with a matching belt. * I already own walnut Strands, so I'd just get the belt to go with them."
"I was recently told that I look pretty good wearing sweaters on top of OCBDs. I am looking to dress nicely today for New Years so I was planning on wearing some kind of dark jeans and some black leather oxfords. That much of my wardrobe is set in stone, I lack a wide variety of pants, the only other option being black slacks, and my shoes are either black oxfords or brown suede wingtips and like running shoes or hiking boots or something equally utilitarian but ugly. I have a dark green, dark red, navy blue, and black sweaters. I wanted to wear the blue one but I'm trying to understand what color to wear. I have almost every color under the sun of OCBD though so that's helpful. Beyond that, I wanted to know what goes best with these color sweaters? I typically see them with white or light grey OCBDs and I wanted to know if that was because the intent is to create a contrast between the dark color of the sweater and the OCBD. Or do certain colors just match better with light and others with dark?"
"I was watching [this news clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=lzIpVVjHsE0#t=28) about Canadian military aid sent to Ukraine, and have noticed @ around 0:28, that crates have Red Cross emblem on them. As far as I know, [Red Cross emblem is protected and is to be used only by ICRC and affiliated organizations](https://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/5a6j7j.htm).  Is there anybody from Canadian Armed Forces here, to clarify if they are taught about use of the Red Cross emblem?  **Edit:** Upon further investigation I found following info on [Canadian Red Cross website](http://www.redcross.ca/who-we-are/about-the-canadian-red-cross/red-cross-emblem): *Restricted use of the emblem* *No organization – except the Canadian Red Cross and the medical services of the armed forces has the right to use the red cross emblem in Canada. The red cross emblem must be readily recognized and respected around the world as a trusted symbol of protection and humanitarian aid. Its use is legislated by the Geneva Conventions Act, the Trade Marks Act and the Canadian Red Cross Society Act.*  [I have also found further description of cargo at CBC](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ukraine-getting-11m-more-in-non-lethal-support-from-canada-1.2850864): The $11 million will be used for equipment and training, including: $5 million for protective gear, including surplus Canadian Forces cold-weather gear such as jackets, hats and gloves. $3 million for explosives disposal equipment. $1 million for communications equipment. $1 million for night and thermal vision equipment, plus binoculars. $1 million for medical training, including a mobile field hospital.   I am guessing that the crates with Red Cross emblem were mobile field hospital related equipment, and if that is the case, then it was acceptable use of Red Cross Emblem by medical services of armed forces."
"I would also be cautious of animals entering your engine bay and eating wires. There are electronic devices you can buy that emit a sound and they don't like that. Other options: peppermint oil, powdered fox urine, used cat litter, cat hair, dog hair, Pine-Sol, Irish Spring soap, red pepper, and laundry dryer sheets. I work as an apprentice mechanic at a Honda Dealership. We've had 3 brand new cars in one week come in because of rats eating wires. ICBC got involved and there has been a ton of back and fourth between them and us. Our shop foreman recently learned newer Hondas, the wires and rubber pieces are being coated in soy bean oil before install so they are easier to install. But the residue stays behind, and when it heats up/starts cooking, it smells kinda nutty. There is also a Story about Toyota's and rats only eating the blue wires. Rats and mice are supposed to be color blind but they kept eating blue wires on Toyota's. They discovered that Toyota was trying to be environmentally friendly and was making the insulation out of plants. The blue wire had a natural dye in it that smelt and rats were attracted to it."
"I would prefer an actual trip to hell than fight another Red Khezu. Lemme start from the beginning. I started playing Monster Hunter in Tri Ultimate, and absolutley fell in love with the series. I put countless hours into 4U and am now engaged to MHWorld. I played lance religiously in 3, became a chargeblade scrub in 4U, and now main both CB and Lance in world until recently. Then I was converted to the Church of Greatsword. So I decided to go back and try my newfound love of greatswords in 4U. I started a new game, from the beginning, using only greatsword. It’s been my favorite playthrough of 4U yet. Then the HR5 (I think) guildquest where you have to fight a Red Khezu. My burning rage is uncontainable. I never really noticed with CB, because it’s generally a faster weapon, so getting out of a tough situation is more forgiving. Also CB was broken in 4U. But with GS you have to commit more, and as such you get punished more. Most often (I find at least), by things like AOE attacks, large sweeps, and projectiles. And what does Red Khezu have in spades? All three. Normal Khezu is annoying with greatsword, but not unreasonable. Red Khezu is just fucking absurd. This crimson bastard overuses his electric attacks, I actually started to think something was broken. Practically zero windup or indication that he’s going to do a regular slow walk forward, or one covered in lightning. The area of his AOEs are just a bit bigger than they seem, so its super difficult to dodge. His annoying ass scream keeps you in the ear covering animation just long enough to stop you from dodging his super fast electric AOE, which he does twice in quick sucession. And in addition, the Khezu family are just bad. Decent idea, but they just come off as stupid instead of creepy, annoying instead of chilling, and just plain ugly and a pain to fight. I fucking hate Red Khezu. I hate him so much I ‘got gud’ and made an entire set of HR Zingore Armor and upgrade my Brachydios GS, JUST to turn this red waste of space into mincemeat. In conclusion, the giant dick monsters can take a trip directly to hell, and the series as a whole would benefit from them just not fucking existing. Ps. They’re also the reason I always try to capture Shrouded Nerscylla. Those big ol spidery bois help us slaughter the screechy fuckers en masse, so I’ve gotta pay my respect. Same for regular Nerscylla and Gypceros."
"I would suggest getting a cheaper pair of sticks and throwing the extra money on this sale. (Samsung Evo 850 250GB SSD and Toshiba 3TB HDD) http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/33p8j8/ssd_hdd_combo_250gb_samsung_850_evo_3tb_toshiba/ DDR3-1600 and up, CAS 10 and below, 1.5v and below, low profile optional, color scheme optional, 2x8GB or (1x8GB)*2, should be around 100-118$. Really for gaming you only need 8GB but I find it nice to go over a bit. I personally mess around with video editing and virtual machines time to time and the extra RAM is always nice. Also, the sticks you chose don't really fit the color scheme you got going on. I would suggest trying to get an all black or red and black RAM sticks. There are even some sticks where the PCB is black. ([Picture of different color PCB just for reference](http://bayareacircuits.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/BAC-Final-Web-106.jpg)) Also, if you don't know what low profile sticks look like you can check out this picture for comparison (first two are low profile while the last one isn't): http://technologyx.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Crucial-Ballistix-8.jpg"
"I'd fear more Etho's revenge rather than the fanboys. His attack machine in last season was already crazy, *but now they've got ICBM*. I can already see antimatter and red matter missiles flying around the server"
"I'd recommend against sweaters with an argyle pattern. It's not a very good look, and sort of goes along with the whole ""don't really know what I'm doing"" thing. As far as boots, it depends. You can pull off boots most times even if it's not snowing. If you're wearing something casual like Clark's Desert Boots (MFA's favorite shoe) then you can wear them pretty much all the time (except for formal wear). Something like [Red Wings](http://www.theshoesnobblog.com/wp-content/uploads/blogger/_tc2OkhJhc-Y/TNmOm6lwFFI/AAAAAAAABMU/QPLCw7iVNrI/s1600/red-wing-shoes-beckman-5069-3688_zoom.jpg) or Thorogoods, etc., are much more dependent on the context of the fit. If you're wearing chinos and an OCBD, it might look out of place. If you're wearing jeans and a flannel, you've got a winner."
"I'd recommend gaijinhunter over arekkz. I watched both for CB, and Arekkz skipped over a couple things that may or may not be minor, or at least he was not entirely clear. For example charging, I thought I had to charge it so my sword would bounce, I didn't realize yellow would charge half and red would charge all (red before the glowing bouncing red). I also preferred the order gaijin went over the weapon and attacks compared to arekkz. Arekkz' video felt a bit like putting the cart before the horse, and gaijin's video helped me understand the weapon better than the other one. That aside, I am not a new player. I think *everyone* would benefit from reading up on weapons they are new to, not just new players."
"I'll be in Arizona and still might be able to watch live (if there's time). Score. [direct image link](http://506sports.com/2017/15-CBS-E.png) - red is our game, blue is NYJ@NO, green MIA@BUF, yellow BAL@CLE"
"I'll give you an example. Note that overall I don't agree that you should be able to opt out of a union, but I do think there needs to be a way to hold your union accountable (maybe a block of people should be able to vote to dissociate themselves from the union if they can show they have distinct interests?). When I was a lifeguard for the city of Montreal, we were covered by the white collar union. So we were basically 40-50 people between the ages of 16-25, mostly working 2 months a year outdoors, covered by the exact same CBA as bureaucrats. We contributed proportionally little of the union's operating budget (i.e.: average salary $12/hr or so, 30 hours a week, for 2 months). This raised the following issues: * The union refused to go to bat for us when we tried to get sunscreen and bathing suits covered as safety equipment/work equipment. Sunscreen is an obvious requirement to avoid skin cancer. Bathing suits were mostly an issue for the girls, but you had to have a red one-piece, and a comfortable one of those costs $50+ and only lasts half a summer with all the chlorine and sun. * The union refused to help us when the head office got pissy at us because someone quit without giving any notice, and started pretty much applying the rulebook to an abusive extent far beyond what it was actually possible to respect (i.e.: rules designed to cover office employees being applied to lifeguards). * The union didn't do anything when we complained that the city was going around from pool to pool safety equipment on safety inspection day so the worker safety inspectors would see brand new equipment and not the old crap we had to actually use. So in a case like that, I do think it's fair to say the union isn't acting in a cohesive group of employees' interests and they should be able to do something. Note that with the seasonal work and high turnaround there were really only about 2 people who could possibly be in charge of a lifeguards' union and it wasn't really a possibility to organize 30 new people every summer."
"I'll listen to CBC Radio (Canada's national, publicly-funded broadcaster) in the car on the way to and from work to hear new Canadian music, but that's pretty much it. I have other stations programmed in the presets, but it's mostly commercials at those times of day, so if I'm not feeling what CBC's playing, I'll switch back to Spotify at the next red light."
"I'm a project engineer for a construction company with a real estate development arm, and this is New England. So, no formal and a hunting lodge, but do have to be out in the field on a job site, but also meet with investors. And I'd just to minimize the dissonance in being under dressed for a meeting, and over dressed for a construction site.  You're reading ""tartan/plaid,"" a pattern, when I've only said ""flannel,"" a fabric.  So the tie had to contrast that. Find the colors that contrast, find a pattern that is much tighter or much looser. For example, if you have the classic lumberjack red and black check I would wear a yellow gold silk knit tie. Or maybe a solid periwinkle blue wool tie. I appreciate the insight, but I didn't ask how to pair a patterned shirt with a tie. I know how to do that. I'm talking about more about textures and contrast.  Wear a scarf to a dinner with an investor client? Are you Wes Anderson?  To transition between very formal and very informal environments while making minimum waves. Aside from how shiny my hard hat is, adding a tie implies authority on a job site while the shirt is still made from a rugged fabric. And wearing a tie to a dinner shows a token gesture that I'm taking this seriously, instead of walking in to Morton's in a polo shirt with the company logo on it. I appreciate the effort you put into this but I think you missed the mark, and the next one, and the next one. I'm talking about trying to remain formal in an informal environment, and trying to change up from the OCBD to a [flannel with a tie](https://astorblack.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/plaid-shirt-astor-black-tie-featured-on-gq.jpg), or even [denim with a tie.](http://blog.trashness.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/denim-and-knitted-shirt-tie-jacket-navy.jpg)."
"I'm fine with self. only, honestly. The post you made about that transautist smuglord was a pretty good template. Can't whore karma. Was entertaining to read. Presented the amusement like a gift. Lacked the exaggerated poutrage SRS beats to death. Wasn't pretentiously verbose like CB tries at. Edit: The screen shot proof was priceless, as well. For the sake of ethics and transparency, I have to admit to being partial to screenshots edited with red shapes, lines, and text."
"I'm going to disagree with blacks &amp; whites. I've got red hair (though it isn't as orange as it used to be, it's still mostly red.

"I'm not sure about a Freudian-specific answer to your question. But I have also noted that I dream less when smoking. Some research suggests that the ""purpose"" for dreaming might be a type of a ""defragmenting"" of our memories and experiences throughout the day. For example, consider a computer that is downloading and storing files as you use it -- browsing the internet, creating, saving files. These files get stored in our memory in whatever space is available. When you defragment a computer (as far as I understand) the computer consolidates similar files or parts of the same file, placing them more proximal to each other so that they can be accessed more efficiently when you use them. SO: (before defragging) ABCBCAAABCBCCAABCBCABCCCBABCBCBCACCBC (after degragging) AAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBBBBBCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC Similarly -- dreaming may take (conscious and unconscious) information that we pick up throughout the day and try to associate it to/with other information that is relevant to it. We might expect that these connections and associations are not (and maybe would not be) necessarily evident to us (ego) consciously. Say for instance your partner had been dropping hints about what to get him/her for Christmas - a pair of red shoes, let's say. You're not the type of guy to pick up on hints, and so suggestion goes un-noted by you (consciously). This particular theory suggests that you might have a dream in which a giant pair of bright red shoes, laced with green ribbons falls out of the sky onto your head. An interpretation of this dream might lead the patient to realize that his partner has been *dropping* hints about this gift for the past several weeks. You could understand this as your mind defragging the information about the Christmas gift, trying to place the partner's hint more proximal to the patient's wondering what to buy his partner. My thought is that when you smoke weed, you might enter into a more reflective state of mind that helps you make some associations that you might not have already made in a sober state of mind. Essentially, browsing your own file system and saying, ""you know what, I think this goes over here!"" -or- ""holy shit! my partner has been talking about those shoes for weeks, maybe that's what s/he wants for Christmas!"" This may be anecdotal, but I tend to be more self-conscious, and self-examining when, I'm high. **TL;DR: Smoking weed may help a person examine their mind and their experiences in a way that is similar to dreaming/REM, thus diminishing our minds' need to carry out this process unconsciously.**"
"I'm trying to be vaguely realistic here: whatever I might like, Cook is going to remain captain, Pietersen's career is over, and players like Compton and Onions won't play for England again. 1. **Cook** (c) - needs to work on his captaincy skills (and slip catching) but he remains one of England's best batsmen ever and if he can rediscover form, he can lead from the front like he did in India. 2. **Robson** - bit surprised no one's mentioned him, clearly the form young opener after an impressive winter for the Lions. 3. **Bell** - I don't think this will happen - I think Trott will come back in (and do well against the medium pacers) - but I'd ideally like for Bell to bat at 3 and play with the authority he showed in 2011; he should also be vice-captain permanently. 4. **Taylor** - his face didn't fit under Flower, but it's clearly his time now. 5. **Root** - has enough class to shake off a rocky winter, assuming his thumb's been superglued back together, and should provide a bit of off-spin too; don't promote him to open until that backfoot problem is sorted, though!! 6. **Woakes** - I'm sure they'll pick Stokes here, but for me Woakes is the superior red ball player, especially with the bat. 7. **Buttler** (wk) - think they might pick Bairstow, even though he had a wretched winter; Buttler's FC stats aren't great and he needs work on his keeping. Honestly, the failures of Kieswetter and Davies to take their chances mean this is one of our weak spots. I wouldn't pick Prior, which is why I think the ECB might. 8. **Borthwick** - I'd like to see him given a chance. Panesar isn't trusted by cook, not sold on Kerrigan yet, a batting spinner like Ali, Root or Patel doesn't offer enough, Rashid is too inconsistent. 9. **Jordan** - give him a chance now before the England set-up completely kills off his natural attacking instincts; also put him at second slip, no offence to Bell. 10. **Broad** - needs some time off, and to come back fit and strong and ready to bowl. 11. **Anderson** - very important that he is able to lead the bowling attack. I wouldn't pick Morgan. Never showed much red ball form. Make him T20 captain, give him a full central contract and show him how important he is to the 2015 ODI WC plans. Ballance should have a chance, but I think we need a five man attack ife we're so unsure of our lead spinner. That means Stokes or Woakes to balance the batting, and one less middle order place. The biggest omission is Finn. Huge fan of his. But I simply don't see how he can be picked until he sends down consistent overs, taking wickets, using a repeatable action and run-up, and not clipping the stumps, at Middlesex. Fraser and Saker also need to sort out their arguments over him."
"I'm working on an Angular CLI website, and I have a login page component. I tried changing the color with body {background-color: red;} in the associated .css file, but that doesn't work, so I tried doing it with * {background-color: red;} to change everything, and [this happens](https://i.imgur.com/lAHCBlN.jpg). Only a small portion of the page gets affected by the change, instead of the whole page. According to [Angular's documentation](https://angular.io/guide/component-styles) I think I should use the :host selector, but doing host: {background-color: red;} and host:(body) {background-color: red;} but nothing happens. Edit: For the rest of the styling I'm using the global .css file, but even after I tried removing it completely to avoid potential conflicts, the results are the same. I also tried styling everything in the global .css file, but the same things happen. Edit 2: When I do * {background-color: red;} on the global .css file, everything turns red as it should, but doesn't work if I just use body, so there must be something else that I have to use. Edit 3: It works when I do * {background-color: red !important;} on the global.css file, but I need to apply it only to the login page, not globally, so that's not good. Edit 4, Solved: Apparently my html element wasn't at 100% heigth for some reason, so I set it to 100% and now it's fixed."
"I've got a lot of those. Gun I ~~fap~~ dream hardest about is a BRNO 7.5 FK Field Pistol. When the hell are they gonna import that. Gun that doesn't exist: a modern modular SBR with folding stock that can be converted to any calibre between 9mm and .308, and doesn't cost as much as the damned SCAR. Gun that isn't manufactured: 9mm carbine using CZ-75 mags. Kel-tec Sub 2000 with Sig P226 mag catch would do it, but fucking Keltec is being Keltec. Gun that used to be impossible: 9mm ""crew-served"" CZ-75 (slide mounted red dot, suppressor height BUIS, suppressor, light). CZ-75 used to be too slim to mount a red dot and a rear sight at the same time, but apparently CZ Custom has never heard of the Deltapoint Pro and they're looking at the possibility of mounting it and its built in BUIS. Gun that I should build: total OEM 10/22, integrally suppressed in CBRPS bullpup stock."
"I've got some tips. PVP Pilot with 700+ hours, and also run a Lawful Good group in Elite, called Iridium Wing. &lt;3 I'm going to write you a guide that's concise and useful. Here's an example of power management in Coriolis: (an Elite Dangerous outfitter) [This is my combat Vulture, Mother of Invention](https://coriolis.edcd.io/outfit/vulture?code=A4patfFalddksif32b2b020400045i5i45272525.Iw1%2FkA%3D%3D.CwBhGYzAmaEYGLlIA%3D%3D%3D.H4sIAAAAAAAAA42Qu0oDURCGR5NdN9k1e8nFRQSj2ShYiJaCkDRqJwFfIL5BSgtLC0sfwTKPkNIXENKks1jEIoVFbERQ53dmYQ8SAnqK4T%2Fn%2B%2Bdyhtghom9Lgtv9AsJrCUlaJ8ISd3LkjFeI%2FIMPoBFUBC1zI0d%2Bs0BU8xioj1yiWK%2Bte19MBV43pt4nEGmR2m1VTFMxociHyovK%2BzPhwxcAFh%2FlWaWBVC1rwy1V26raqnayIWzum%2FpXr5L%2FkAL7x%2B9SxOGLHFk30suevQGxNmndTYWX%2FuBlbisXQqQDR8Eu0YYquHxmFvYss%2Fupbk1V3LWJElXw2FuQn%2F16lU%2FM1E8So%2BGlpOpqNnunwgM%2BN1zXGDblw8lgTVDIe6b1o8SKvoaqstUmqhD9Mk2MaWJMqlD9jwk0f34AhAzgIC0CAAA%3D.CwegDCBM4gHDAzApgJwPoBMloDYEMA7AYyRAHUBLAgF1QHIBnAAgBlCSmAKBAShAGZIAVkhA&amp;bn=Mother%20of%20Invention) If you scroll down to the tab that says ""Power and Costs"" you can see what I've done with my power management, so you can follow along while you read. **NOTE** Priority 1 should ALWAYS add up to less than that blue line at 40%. Remember that Elite Dangerous features module damage. People can target, shoot at, and kill specific modules! If someone kills your power plant and it malfunctions, then your power will drop to 40%. Anything above that line will SHUT DOWN. If your ship is not power managed and your plant gets hit, your entire ship will shut down, and you'll be a floating coffin. ------------- **Priority 1** Here, we include the bare minimum for survival and movement: * Thrusters - help you get away, they are vital for staying alive. * Power Distributor - let you boost, and cycle power to engines, shields, etc. * Sensors - vital for being able to dock your ship... so you must have them. * Life Support - give your pilot oxygen even if the ship canopy gets blown. * (Frame Shift Drive, if you can). - lets you warp. I did NOT put this in Priority 1 because It would put me over 40% -------------- **Priority 2** These are all the ""constant running"" things you rely on, which are generally termed ship defenses/utilities. Pri 2 is what should be running ALL the time even if your weapons deploy. * Shield Boosters (x2) - boost my shield strength! * Chaff Launcher (x1) - throws off other people's aim. * Shield Generator - Vital to keeping your shields up. Notice I didn't put this in priority 1. Why? because if your power plant takes a hit, your shield gen is already down/fried. * Shield Cell Bank (Active) - These are little batteries you can ""fire"" to rapidly charge your shield. Generates tons of heat, and uses LOTS of power. * Shield Cell Bank (disabled) - Same as above, but I've DISABLED this one. It's a backup, in case I run out of shield cells in the fist bank, I can turn that one off, and turn this one on! :D Or, I can keep them both on. * Heat Sink Launcher - remember that I said shield cell banks generate tons of heat? well, this guy lets me vent heat immediately. It prevents me from cooking to death :D These are all priority 2. Notice how they are DEFENSIVE attachments. They either boost my shields, or let me throw off people's aim, or vent heat. ----------------- **Priority 3** Weapon Systems Here, I include ONLY weapon systems. When weapons are stowed away, Priority 3 requires NO power. * Plasma Accelerator (x2) - High power / high damage / low ammo weapon. difficult to use, but deadly as fuck (6-8 shot kill on most small ships) ----------- These are modules you can disable if your weapons use lots of power. If you enable my second Shield Cell Bank, then these modules get pushed into the ""red"" which means they shut down during combat for me. So, **when I have my weapons deployed, these things DO NOT work**. When I have my weapons stowed, they work perfectly. **Priority 4** - Stuff that you do NOT need in combat * Frame Shift Drive - since i couldn't fit this in Priority 1, and it's not used it combat, it goes here. **Priority 5** - Stuff that's rarely used, and not needed in combat. * Cargo Hatch - Unless I'm scooping loot after a fight, I won't use this in battle. So it stays out here."
"I've seen some people start to talk about how SBMM has helped the majority and how good crucible players ""finally know what it's like to struggle."" Here's my 2 cents on that thought process.   If you do bad in the raid in pve and get booted what do you do? You learn the mechanics, you watch videos, you have sherpas explain it to you. All of these things so you can pull your own weight and benefit the group to finish the raid. Why is it that nobody has a problem respecting that notion but if they care about crucible enough to get upset at being beat they don't want to try and better themselves. Some things that happen in upper tier SBMM. There are a smaller amount of higher tier players meaning often times these better skilled players constantly have to pull from higher or lower tiers to get matches creating wild inconsistencies in bungies grand SBMM averaging for everyone. Maybe a player in a B tier cannot find enough players in their tier so they have to start matching up with A and S tier opponents just to find a match. Maybe that B tier fighter finds other B tier opponents but they're all scattered around the world and an opponent with a red bar has a distinct ping advantage and is on top of the leaderboards. Maybe a B tier player will get matched with a team full of D tier teammates against a team full of C tier opponents to even out the skill value, which just leads to the B tier player getting rolled due to their less than stellar teammates.   Although people like to say higher skilled opponents now know what it's like to be inadequate or bad it just isn't true. Bungies ideas are severely flawed and although it keeps the worse players grouped up for a more ""fair"" experience it makes for a much more flawed online experience for anyone who is above average. Sure you started playing much better all of the sudden and wow you actually hold your own! Good for you, you can thank Bungie for putting you in the remedial class where everyone reads just as slow as you, you're just a little faster. Everybody has had to get better at a game at some point, why should Bungie be the only one that just holds your hand. If you're invested in crucible enough to hate losing when it was CBMM but now you're happy to finally be doing good in SBMM crucible without having to actually learn, train and get better just remember that Bungie put the kid gloves on for you and you're only beating people just as bad as you. That isn't skill, that isn't something to brag about, that isn't something you can find a sense of pride in or something you can truly learn from. You're just the fastest reader in your remedial class and you can thank Bungie for putting you in there so you're feelings don't get hurt.  I apologize for the harsh wording but I'm tired of below average players trying to invalidate my enjoyment of the game for theirs. If I take the time to put in the game to get better and learn shouldn't I be rewarded? If you do nothing but get upset, frustrated and never try to learn from any negative crucible experiences why should you be rewarded and I just sit here and deal with it. I'm not asking to steamroll bad kids every match. I'm not asking to feel like a crucible God playing against someone who has played 1/10th the amount I have. I'm just asking to be able to enjoy myself in crucible again without running into one of the three major problems I stated above every. Single. Match."
"IMO I doubt we'll match anything for AR with what we're paying Garcon and Goodwin, but if we are going WR it would be more depth related because that's how Shanny rolls. Here is my predictions (based on position) of who we may go after and I won't go star heavy because I believe we'll be in talks, but if players ask for too much John Lynch, Kyle, and Paraag will just move on. I'll list two players I think they'd go after and if there's a gamble then I'll put him on the list. WR Donte Moncrief- was a useful big body for Luck in the red zone and created good separation, but the downside was his work ethic when Luck was out. Eric Decker- Even though he's up there in age I still believe he can perform with a QB like Jimmy. Terrelle Pryor (Gamble) - He's a big body that doesn't know how to use his size as a Wr yet because he's been a Browns WR and a system that uses the RB more. Shanahan knows how to develop these types of receivers and use them, so why would'nt we try? RB Jerrick Mckinnon- What does Shanahan like in his Rb's? Catching! Let's be honest Matt B (though he's great) is not our 3rd Down back and Mckinnon I think can be an every down back. Rex Burkhead- He had a similar roll in NE as the 3rd down back and seems like he's fine not being the center of attention. Isaiah Crowell (Gamble)- He's a Browns Rb that was apart of their 0-16 season and seemed like he wasn't used as much as Duke Johnson. Shanahan knows how to make a Rb look good with his build. I'd also consider Lagarrette Blount for his championship experience since he's been apart or the last two. TE Tyler Eifort (GAMBLE)- This is the only TE I'd consider, but he's just glass. Back up OT Andre Smith- Though he's older he'd be a reliable back up if someone got hurt. OG Josh Sitton (Gamble) - He's getting up there in age, but I think he'd be a great add with his size and background since he made Jorden Howard look good.My concern is his possible character issues. Jonathan Cooper - He's apart of the Dallas OL so maybe we can get something out of him. Josh Kline- I think he'll open up our run game more since that's what he's done for Derrick Henry and in the past Murray. DE Alex Okafor- We'd have two Achilles problems and a Baalke reminder, but he was very dominant before the injury and was a key for the Saints defense. Adrian Clayborn- Hopefully he isn't coming into FA all high and mighty after his sack session against Dallas, but he's be a reliable fit. Julius Peppers- Veteran leadership, cheap contract, had more sacks than everyone on our team last year at 38. LB Paul Posluszny- Vet leadership, was great for Jacksonville and he's be cheaper than most. Karlos Dansby- Vet leadership again and cheap contract. CB Rashaan Melvin- He can get a tackle but he won't be in our starting line up. Davon House- Good insurance policy cb. S Trey Boston- Just a backup and insurance. I think we'll be going DE, Rb, LB, Oline and Wr in the draft, so I don't think we'll throw too much money into those positions as assumed."

"Improved but still overall weak--which is exactly what we were hoping for after last year. It's still a little early to tell, because a lot of guys look like they might still be getting used to the new scheme. The run defense is spastic. They've had stretches of looking significantly improved and stretches of looking just as bad as last year. However, they did an okay job against Baltimore who have maybe the best overall rushing attack in the league and outside of a handful of carries mostly held Fournette in check. But then they fell on their face for the most part against Detroit. Passing defense is much better. Ward seems to have regressed some from last year--probably struggling due to the switch more zone I guess. Fuller is still okay. Breeland is playing average, which is a huge upgrade. The main problem in the passing game last year was actually our safety play. Those dudes were always out of position, which really screwed the corners who should have been able to count on help. Mathieu is a huge upgrade, despite taking the first week or two to find his groove. Now he's improving. Thornhill has had some typical rookie issues but has still played like a legitimate starter. LBs are still atrocious outside of maybe Wilson. I think they're the main problem. I know we all want Veach to get a CB, but I think if he got us an upgrade or two at LB it might be just as helpful. The line is starting to look really good after a slow start. Okafor and Ogbah are both pleasant surprises, playing really well. Clark has played pretty well--especially since he's regularly attracting multiple blockers and plays run away from him--but he's not played up to the elite level needed to justify his huge cost in my opinion. But, like with Mathieu, it might just be growing pains in a new defense. He's definitely looked better over the last few weeks. Chris Jones is Chris Jones. God I hope we keep him. I haven't checked the stats, but it looks to me like third down and red zone defense has massively improved from last year, which is the most important bit. We won't be the Bears with our current defensive squad, but we now look like a legitimate bend-don't-break squad rather than the bend-then-break group we were last year."

"In my puberty I was kind of straight-edge. Not ""to be part of that club"", but I just didn't drink any alcohol, never did any drugs etc. In my late twenties I started feeling a slight regret about it, as actually I'm someone who's rather curious and wants to have experienced everything at least once. So I started playing with the idea to test out some things just to see what it does, and documenting it properly: price / dosage, effect, intensity, duration ... I also let go of some of my teenage principles and started sipping of the drinks of my wife just to have a taste, or accepting the glass of whatever I got offered at a party instead of refusing. Last year I tried drinking a caipiroska, which was the first and still the only alcoholic drink so far that I like. But reaching 30, I had never been ""under the influence"" of anything. About two months ago, something happened and I'm going through a difficult period since then. The idea of experimenting with substances to see if anything can lighten up my mood resurfaced, and now there was an actual reason for it. I started reading up about what's out there, the legality, effects and side-effects, risks (didn't want a bad trip) etc. and decided to start building from the ground up. From two online headshops I bought a few legal things: THC-less CBD Oil (in a legal grey zone over here), a Boundless CFX vaporizer, a few dried herbs which were said to have ""some"" tame effect: blue lotus, catmint ..., kanna and a pocket precision scale. I bought the vaporizer with the intention of trying weed. As this is illegal here, I was still on the lookout for it. (Quickly found a couple of dealers via a forum, but only delivering big quantities which I didn't want.) The first thing I tried was a tea with catmint and blue lotus. I wouldn't call it a complete placebo as my arms felt somewhat heavier and I might have felt a bit more tired, but besides that nothing really happened. I then tried the CBD oil sublingual and started using almost daily, as this clearly did help me let go of negative thoughts faster when I was in a bad place. Vaped blue lotus and catmint to get used to how the Boundless CFX works, but didn't feel much. By then I was able to buy some hashish via a colleague who's a regular user. Crumbled a bit in the concentrate pod of the vaporizer, set it on medium-high temperature and took a bunch of big deep hits, but was left underwhelmed as it didn't make me feel much different than CBD oil which works faster, is easier to use and takes no prep or cleanup. Tried kanna as a snuff: not all that effective. So yesterday evening I decided to try vaping the hashish for a second time, but now doubling the amount. Took a bath with my wife (who smoked a bunch when she was younger), and because last time really left me unsatisfied I also increased the temperature to the maximum and took real deep hits, giving me an itchy throat and coughing hot lungs. Twenty minutes in, I was again starting to feel let down. When I raised my hand to get a sip of water, I noticed my arm felt lighter, yet required more muscle force to move. Colours were more vibrant and I felt a bit ""numbed"" when watching videos, things I had also noticed the first time. I drew some more deep hits. About ten-fifteen minutes later the THC finally started to kick in. The first thing that deeply impressed me was the change in depth / dimensions of the room around me. We were sitting in a not very big bathtub, yet it felt like my wife was sitting much further away. I started feeling a bit ""wavy"". The articles I was reading didn't really ""stick"" and the sound of the videos I was watching on my phone sounded kind of like a radio playing in a tv show. I liked the fact that I could still keep a sane focus when I wanted to. I could talk normally, describe the effects clearly to my wife. Was speaking maybe a bit slower, but felt like I still had my shit together. The first thing where I did feel a loss of control was that my mouth wanted to smile even though nothing was particularly funny. I actually had to confirm by feeling with my fingertips that my mouth was, in fact, not smiling. When my wife got up from the bathtub she looked way taller, and when getting up myself I got into a first fit of laughter because I felt like a toddler standing up for the first time. Looking in the mirror I saw I had the droopy red eyes and the corners of my mouth had physically gone up to the shit-eating grin for no good reason. Going to bed I found myself a Youtube video with these trippy psychedelic visuals, curious about the effect. Well I'd r8 8/8: immensely satisfying, way more than expected. The colours were so vibrant and I got really sucked into a 3D-like depth-effect. The dimensions and space around me also still felt way bigger. It was like lying in the middle of a big-ass trampoline in a sunny garden instead of in my bed. At some point, I wanted to stretch out my body. When I activated my muscles and realised I was actually already stretched out I found this immensely funny and couldn't control my laughter for a solid minute. Next up was music. I don't have Spotify premium and didn't want any ads to ruin the experience. I also don't have a lot of offline music on my phone, something I regretted not preparing well for. My first choice was Burial's Untrue. Probably my all-time favourite album and even in a 100% sober state it can usually get me dozing off to another place in no time. Five minutes in, it was not what I had hoped it would be. ""Black Beatles"" by Rae Sremmurd was next, a song I sometimes listen to when walking the dog in the late evening, always gives me a good night-air vibe. Tremendous effect. I heard everything so much better. The voices sounded ""real"", the bassline was very clear and deep so I could really follow and analyse it better. I put that song on repeat for a few times, and each time I noticed more subtleties that went unnoticed when sober. Very cool. I then started to feel very sleepy so decided to get some much-needed rest. Some negativity about recent circumstances started to come up, but I was able to let go (similar to the effect of the CBD oil), so in no time I was fast asleep. Today I'm having a bit of an achy throat and feel still a bit drowsy or maybe it's just that I'm still suffering from a lack of sleep. Next times, I'll stick to the same amount of hashish, but lower the temperature a bit. I still want to see what the effect is on comedy, food, more music and sex. TL;DR: got shitfaced, moarboar wants moar."
"It all started ten years ago, when I was thirteen years old. I stood outside, beside my school’s parking lot, on a sunny, autumn afternoon, waiting for my friend Alex’s dad to pick me up. I was looking forward to seeing Alex again, it would be the first time we hung out in a while, so naturally I was anxiously awaiting the arrival of his dad’s dark red Camry, with the unmistakable dent on the front; it was quite a sight, it looked as if someone had pressed their hand into the hood at full force; one would expect the the hood to bend a little under this circumstance, but there was literally a perfect hand print engraved into it, as if it were memory foam. Alex’s dad never told us how he got such an odd dent on his car, in fact, he froze up every time we brought it up. I was excited to ride in the absurd car, normally Alex’s mom picked me up when we planned on hanging out, but she was away on a business trip, so I was gonna ride in his dad’s car for the first time. After a few minutes of swaying back and forth, and staring at the nearly empty lot, I finally spotted the car, and with it, the hand-shaped dent. Alex’s dad pulled up next to me, and I hopped in the back. “Hey, kiddo.” He said, in his familiar, cheery voice. “Hi Mr. Kelly.” “You looking forward to seeing Alex?” “Yep, sure am.” “Glad to here it. Well, buckle up and we’ll get going.” I buckled myself in, and Alex’s dad started driving. As he approached the exit, a computerized voice spoke. **Turn, left, in, approximately, 20, feet.** It was a GPS, mounted on the windshield, by a built in suction cup. I always thought they were pretty neat devices, especially the more sophisticated ones with built in voices. However, I couldn’t help but notice that it was leading Alex’s dad in the wrong direction, his mom had always turned right when she left the school. I didn’t want him to end up lost, so I told him. “Hey, Mr. Kelly.” “What’s up, kiddo?” “The GPS is leading you the wrong way, you’re supposed to turn right at this street.” “Wrong… way?” He responded, suddenly sounding very disoriented. “Why, that’s impossible.” “Well, Alex’s mom always goes the other way.” He fell silent for a moment, and as he came up to the turn, he suddenly slammed on the breaks. I shot forward, surprised, it was the last thing I expected him to do. After a few seconds, he spoke in a very serious tone. “Drew has given me directions. And I must follow them. They are the right way. The only way.” I was speechless, and surprised at his sudden change of mood. He promptly resumed driving, turning left, as the GPS-or Drew as he called it-had said. After that, “Drew” began leading him in all sorts of strange directions; at one point, he drove down a small dirt road, covered in fallen red leaves, only to leave it the same way. After about an hour of this wild goose chase, we finally ended up at Alex’s house. I was furious with his dad, but didn’t say anything, I didn’t want to fight him. I was just happy to finally be at Alex’s house. About nine years passed, without any more weird encounters with Alex’s dad; I made sure that I never got picked up by him again. This proved difficult for a while, since his mother got progressively more and more busy with work; we didn’t hang out nearly as often, but it was worth it. Anyways, by this point in my life I had my own car, and was able to see Alex more often; despite this, I still didn’t see him all that much, especially with the huge work load that apparently came with being a college senior. We chatted on Skype pretty often, but seldom met in person. We had planned to take a road trip together over winter break, which was coming up shortly, and I couldn’t wait. Then, on the day before winter break, something devastating happened: Alex’s dad committed suicide. It was completely out of nowhere, his job was going well, and from what I understood his marriage was stable. I couldn’t imagine why he would do himself in out of the blue. But of course, the trip was canceled. Alex was devastated, and I did my best to comfort him for the next several weeks, but nothing seemed to help. One day in March, Alex told me that he and his mother were giving away his fathers possessions, in an effort to move on with their lives and stop living in anguish; he asked me if I wanted anything of his, I couldn’t think of anything at the moment, but figured it wouldn’t do any harm to see what he had. I showed up at his house the following day, and he led me up to the attic where his father’s stuff was being stored. I squatted so as not to touch the fiberglass with my head, and looked around; there was still a lot of stuff they hadn’t gotten rid of, and none of it seemed too interesting to me. But then, I saw something that looked oddly familiar in a small pile of junk. It was the old GPS his father had used. I picked it up, and examined it. It was outdated, and covered in dust, but was still in relatively good condition. I figured it might be nice to have a GPS for my car, even though it was old, and didn’t always work, as I recall from the irritating drive with the old man. So I asked Alex if I could keep it, and he said sure. After that, we hung out for a while, it was nice to see him again. I said my goodbyes to Alex and his widowed mother, and got in my car, with the GPS in my pocket. I took it out and examined it, it had a generic looking logo at the bottom, reading Destination DRU. I couldn’t help but wonder what D-R-U stood for, and then I realized something. Drew. Alex’s dad had called the GPS by the name of Drew. I thought he had named it or something, because he was weird like that, but it was actually called “DRU.” I pressed the on button, and surprisingly, it still had some battery life remaining. A little jingle played, as the logo appeared on the screen, followed by a menu screen. It read “Welcome back Mr. Kelly!” And then in the bottom corner, “Not you?” It seemed weird to me that it operated like a social network or something, what does it matter who’s using it? But I made a new account all the same. When I did, it started speaking to me in it’s computerized voice. **Why hello there, mister, misses, or miss, Collins, I am the Directive Route Unit, or DRU for short, I am the latest and greatest in GPS technology, I will be helping you every step of the way, so buckle up, enjoy the ride, and most importantly, be safe.** I couldn’t help but chuckle a little, it sounded like an ad for an 80′s computer, it was the corniest thing I had ever heard. After that little number, courtesy of “DRU,” I fixed it to my windshield, and punched in my home address to see if it would plot the quickest route, or if it would malfunction like before. To my surprise, it picked the correct destination, and I drove home, chuckling at it’s corny 80′s computer voice at every turn. I pulled into my driveway. **You have arrived.** The next morning was Sunday, and I was famished. I had finished all my homework last night, and I had no plans, so I figured I’d go get breakfast at a diner or something. I got in my car, and punched in “breakfast” on DRU. I got a number of results, most of which were restaurants, but one result in particular intrigued me; it read “How to make a breakfast burrito.” Curious, I selected this option to see what it entailed. It mapped out a route to my local grocery store. **Go, 5, miles, down, Resin Rock, Avenue.** I wasn’t entirely sure where it was going with this, but I followed it’s directions all the same. When I arrived at the grocery store, DRU said something that made me do a double take. **Remove, me, from, the, car, and, take, me, into, the, store, with, you.** I couldn’t believe my ears, just how many phrases was this thing programed with? I took it in the store with me, and to my further amazement, it started directing me to various aisles. **Go, to, aisle, 4, and, pick out, some, organic, eggs.** Pretty soon, I had all of the ingredients required to make a breakfast burrito. I checked out, and drove home, following the same route that DRU had suggested. When I got home, it had me take it into the house, and then, it started giving me instructions on how to prepare the burrito. After a while, I had a very delicious looking breakfast burrito. **You have arrived.** It was the most delicious breakfast I had eaten in a while, and it was all thanks to DRU. It was April now, and for the past few weeks, I continued fiddling with DRU, he showed me all sorts of neat things. How to build a kite, how to fix my cable, how to bake a cake, and so much more. I didn’t even care what I did, doing it was just so much fun; I knew that as long as I followed DRU’s directions, I could achieve anything. It felt as if he were not a machine, but a conscious being, with a very high intellect. The final exam was coming up pretty soon, and I knew DRU would help me pass it with flying colors. I punched in “college final,” and DRU started searching. He came up with a number of results, one of them being “How to pass your final exam.” Naturally, I selected it, eager to hear his electronic words of wisdom. **Write, down, the, following, notes, on, a, note card, and, bring, it, in, for, the, test.** He shortly displayed a message: **ACDBCABCDBADBBCBABDCBCADCBACDBABBCDACD…** It went on for a while. At first, I was confused, they didn’t look like helpful notes at all, but then I realized it: DRU wanted me to cheat. I was extremely apprehensive of taking his advice this time. But then I remembered what he had said when I first inherited him. **“I will be helping you every step of the way.”** DRU was more than a mere machine, he was my mentor, and my friend; he had never steered me wrong before, so I decided to listen to his advice and bring the cheat sheet. Finals week came shortly, and I drove up to my college, anxious about getting found out. As I pulled up in the college parking lot, DRU gave me further instruction. **When, entering, the, testing, room, make, sure, to, sit, in, the, back, left, corner.** I entered the testing room, with nothing but a pencil, and my cheat sheet. I promptly claimed the seat in the back-left corner. I could see that DRU had once again given me good directions, the desk was partially hidden behind a pillar with a piece of gum stuck to it at eye level. I stuck the cheat sheet on the gum, and began the test. As I marked up all the test, I made sure to put the wrong answers for some questions, to avoid getting a suspiciously perfect grade. After I finished marking it up, I waited around until I saw other students start to leave. It was pretty boring, but Julie, a girl I had a crush on was, sitting just a few seats away; I spent the remaining time watching her take the test, and daydreaming about us together. I finally handed in my test, confident in a good score. Still, I couldn’t help but feel a little ashamed about cheating. I left the school, and entered my car to the familiar sound of DRU’s voice. **You have arrived.**"
"It could be a system issue, who knows, but BCBS isn't singling you out to make it difficult for you to fill a prescription. Did you recently go through a benefit change? Does this medication require a prior authorization because it's name brand and you no longer have a prior authorization? What's nice about pharmacy is that it processes in real time compared to medical claims processing so if an override or flag removal needs to happen, you shouldn't have to wait long for that to happen.  Is this claim actually processing through insurance or is it being denied? If it's being denied due to the ""red flag"", your pharmacist should see the denial reason on their end and that would also clue you/them in on needed resolution. I'd wait til this afternoon but if you don't hear anything by about 2-3pm your time, patiently call back (despite how frustrated you obviously are), provide reference numbers if you have them or call the supervisor directly if you have an extension. Keep in mind that, unless you have a direct line to the supervisor, the pharmacy claims rep you speak to will have to read any notes and familiarize themselves with the situation to better determine how to assist you."

"It was just another Friday night like so many before. Jim from Accounting was at the bar trying to pick up a chick and failing spectacularly. Felicia from HR was taking her time deciding what type of drinks she wanted, hoping that Allen from Requisitions would buy her one some night. Allen was peeling the label off his bottle, oblivious to Felicia's obvious crush on him. And Bob from Requisitions and I were watching the Raptors beat up on the Rockets. Just as Lowry sank a three to put the Raptors up by 24, Bob slapped the table and shouted, ""goddammit!"" ""What's the matter?"" I asked. Bob ran his hands through his thinning hair, frowning deeply. ""I just realized that I fucked up the last 107-P before I clocked out last week. Dammit!"" ""Dude,"" I replied calmy, nursing the last of my beer, ""it's just a requisition form; it's not the end of the world."" Allen nodded in agreement without looking over at us. ""Yeeeah, about that: I work with NORAD early detection stations; I fuck up a form, kapow! Russia blows us all to smithereens!"" ""You're being melodramatic, Bob"" Felicia interjected. ""Right, Allen?"" Allen just shrugged. ""I suppose."" ""Hey guys!"" Jim called from the bar. He was pointing wildly at the television. Instead of the basketball game, the channel had been switched to the CBC. On the screen were dozens of tanks, clearly marked with Russian flags and Cyrillic script. The caption read *BREAKING: Tallinn, Estonia*. Clearly it was an invasion: the tanks were firing into buildings, people were running for their lives, Russian infantry were dashing through the streets, firing indiscriminately in all directions. Jim slowly sat next to me, not taking his eyes off the screen. The five of us stared silently for a moment before Felicia broke the silence. ""So... where exactly is Estonia?"" ""It's in the Baltics, south of Finland,"" Allen replied. He turned to look at her; I couldn't recall that having happened before. ""It used to be a part of the Soviet Union. Russia has had its eyes on the Baltic States ever since the Soviet Union dissolved."" Felicia smiled at him. ""You're really smart,"" she said as she pushed her glasses up on her face. ""Same goes for Latvia,"" he said as he pointed at the television. The scene was essentially the same, but the caption now read *Russians take Riga, Latvia and Tallinn, Estonia*. ""Two countries!?"" Jim exclaimed. Bob just shook his head. ""This can't end well. What have I done??"" ""Bob,"" I said, ""it was one form. It's not like you were supposed to ship ballistic missiles, right?"" ""Well...."" ""Jesus, Bob,"" Felicia shouted, ""you aren't going to be like this all night, are you? You work with interagency non-critical shipping. I don't think ballistic missiles are your department."" ""I'm going to get another round,"" Jim interrupted. ""Hopefully Bob didn't accidentally ruin the world's beer supply, too."" ""C'mon, man...."" Bob replied weakly. ""Felicia's got a point,"" Allen replied. ""You tend to make mountains out of molehill sometimes."" ""What is this, 'beat up on Bob day'?"" ""No,"" Felicia said. ""But remember last week when you thought you had stomach cancer? What did it turn out to be?"" ""Never mind that. Look, we're going to be at war soon. And If I hurt our defence capabilities in some way...."" ""Guys, as much as I enjoy listening to you argue over a 294-Q or whatever form it was,"" Allen interjected, ""I have to go to Ottawa tomorrow. So I'm calling it a night."" He paused for a moment as he slipped his coat on. ""It's pretty cold out, and you only live a block or two from me. Do you want to share a cab, Felicia?"" An enormous smile spread across her face; she looked as if she'd won the Lotto. ""Uhh, yeah,"" she replied, her voice sounding an octave higher than normal. ""That's a great idea!"" ""Great. You get ready and I'll go wave down a cab."" Just as he stepped outside, Felicia began hurriedly gathering her items. ""Good luck!"" I shouted after her as she practically bolted out the door. Bob slumped into his seat. ""She didn't even pay for her onion rings."" ""I'll cover her onion rings,"" I said. ""Lord only knows she's been waiting for this for months now."" I paused for a moment. ""What exactly was the 107-P a requisition for, Bob?"" He glanced away, then muttered something under his breath. ""Wanna repeat that, Bob?"" I asked. ""Penny roll tubes."" I was stunned. ""Penny...? You do know we don't even use pennies anymore, right?"" ""Yeah, but the ones at the NORAD sites hadn't been taken out of circulation yet since they're up in the Arctic Circle. So my department ordered 10,000 tubes so they could mail them."" ""Jesus, Bob! All that fussing was about **penny tubes**?! No wonder Allen and Felicia couldn't wait to get the heck out of here. I'm sorry, Bob, but you can be a bit of a pill sometimes."" ""Hey guys!"" Jim called from the bar. ""Look!"" He was pointing at the television again. This time the screen said something completely different: *CityTV Movie of the Week*. ""Man, I feel like a dope, thinking that was real."" ""So we're not at war with the Russians?"" Bob asked. ""No, Bob,"" I said. ""Your misfiled penny rolls haven't doomed us after all."" ""Penny rolls?"" Jim asked as he set our drinks down. ""Long story,"" I replied. ""Oh. Where did the lovebirds go?"" ""Back to theirs. Bob scared them off. With any luck, Felicia's got him tied to her bedposts by now."" ""There's no need to be vulgar,"" Bob retorted. Just then there was a blinding flash from the corner of the bar. A man dressed in a strange red jumpsuit with electronic circuitry along the seams began shouting, ""is today March 25th, 2016??"" over and over. Finally one guy nodded his head at the kook. He came rushing our way, and as he approached, I realised who it was: Bob, but thirty years or so older. He launched himself toward our table. ""Holy shit!"" Jim exclaimed. ""Is... Are you... is this a relative of yours, Bob?"" ""I think... it's me...."" ""I am you!"" Jumpsuit Bob bellowed. ""Where are Felicia and Allen?!"" ""Umm... they left about thirty minutes ago,"" Bob said. ""Too late. I'm too late."" ""Too late for what?"" Jim asked. ""Their child conceived tonight! In thirty-two years he'll destroy everything! Ten long years of nuclear war! Mass extinction! And he has me to thank for even existing!!"" ""Hold on,"" I yelled. ""What do you mean he has you to thank? Who's 'he'?"" ""Their child, the Emperor of an empty wasteland. He told me the story his parents told him: I drove them out of a bar-- this very bar on this night!-- with my (as he put it) 'incessant worrying' about the penny rolls. Felicia made a joke about me, he invited her up for drinks, and then HE was conceived."" None of us could speak; it was all too surreal. Finally Jim broke the ice. ""But this is all in the future, right? We can stop all of this?"" ""They followed me,"" Jumpsuit Bob said, and instantly there were four more flashes of light next to our table. Three men and a woman in similar blue jumpsuits appeared, their guns trained on us. ""Nice try, Bob,"" one of the men said. ""But it didn't work. And now...."" He pulled the trigger, and in a flash of sparks Jumpsuit Bob fell down dead. ""What are we going to do about these ones, Frank?"" the woman asked. ""Now that you've called me by name?"" Frank said as he aimed his weapon at me."
"It was very much a gay bar before the earthquakes. After the CBD red zone was brought down, it was the only ""night club"" and only bar with a licence until 5am. Everyone piled in but I remember the gay community having a whinge in the press about all the straights in the bar. That was 5 or 6 years ago. I presume it has returned to normality now?"
"It will never be a CB, Giroud or Perez would be the most likely to go in goal I'd imagine. If we ever need to put an outfield player in goal it's because either both our keepers have been injured or we've ran out of substitutions and there's been a red card or injury to our keeper. Either way we would be down to 10 men which means we need to defend more than attack"
"It will never happen at a federal level because of the constitution. And even if they were to succeed in legislating it there are so many millions of untracked guns and ""out of my cold dead hands"" people in the US you'll never even get a majority of them. It is not an achievable goal. Functionally what happens is the anti-gun lobby goes after specific models, which leads to even more acquisitions by people fearing a ban, and even more guns in circulation.  Far more effort has been put into frivolously attempting to ban guns than fixing healthcare and quality of life. Far more. Why? If banning guns was achievable I would call it a supportable goal, but as it stands it isn't worth wasting the political capital on.  Focusing on the AR-15 is so fucking stupid and counterproductive. There are so may other semi-auto .223's that are just as lethal, and in some cases worse. One of the worst mass shootings in Canadian history was using a .223 semi that still has 0 extra restrictions on it, to my knowledge we've never had one with an AR-15. Focusing on the AR-15 is like trying to ban red cars because people who want fast cars usually buy red cars and the commercials usually make sports cars red. It's all cosmetic.  Way back when, when I owned guns I was routinely importing 30 round mags through CBSA. We have a rule that says you have to put a rivet in that takes a pair of pliers and 10s to take out. It changes absolutely nothing. We also have a law that says you have to wear a seatbelt but pressing the button and removing it is all it takes to not wear a seat belt.  Only restricted which includes handguns and a very short list.  Nope. You apply for a federal license which entitles you to acquire and own firearms until it's expiry. Transactions are not subject to background checks.  Nope, sort of (We have cold dead hands people too, and millions of untracked guns. Firearms are a necessary part of life in some rural parts of Canada). Character references? Nah.  You put some names on the PAL application but they are not contacted. We only have a registry for restricted firearms (AR-15 + handguns). Look, I'm not defending owning guns. I don't own guns and don't really want to own guns. I am not a gun nut. But the anti-gun lobby has been pursuing the same methods for decades and the only result is more gun violence and higher ownership rates. At what point do you take a look at it and say, hmmm, perhaps another approach is warranted? Beyond health care, education, social security, things can be tried like: * Getting rid of concealed carry * Getting rid of the need for castle doctrine * Getting rid of castle doctrine * Getting a federal system of licensing * Getting actual storage laws to stop kids from find them * Controlling ammunition Try anything else? Why is it always AR-15's and the shoulder thing that goes up?"

"It's because they can. The FDA, the organization in charge of labeling our foods, except for meat and poultry products, which is ran by the USDA, has been taken over by industry executives. And industry executives don't want you to know what's in your food. They have worked hard to make sure that certain things get classified as ""natural flavorings"" or ""artificial flavorings"" (or colorings as well) instead of being listed as what they exactly are. They claim that this is to product industry secrets. We'll see. The FDA is pretty ambiguous when it comes to what Natural Flavoring means... it only means that the original source must be a plant or an animal. The ""Natural Flavoring"" can contain other non-natural components, called ""incidental additives"", which you have no right to know about, according to the FDA. ""Artificial Flavoring"" (again, or Coloring) is a man-made chemical. Some ""natural flavorings"" are pretty harmless. Recently the FDA allowed Amyl Acetate to be classified as a ""natural flavoring""; it is distilled from bananas to be used as a banana flavoring. But other natural flavors include things like Castoreum. Long used as an artificial vanilla flavor, and used in creating artificial raspberry flavors for use in cakes, cookies, ice creams, candy, alcoholic beverages, frozen dairy, and chewing gum, among other things. Castoreum is found in something called a Castor Sack, located on the ass-end of a beaver. The beaver uses its Castor Sack as a scent gland, we use it for our TCBY fro-yo, and the FDA told us that we didn't need to know about that. Good luck if you're a vegan or a vegetarian trying to stay away from the product; you have no right to know about it. Good luck if you're an animal activist, and you don't want to support companies that harm wildlife; you have no right to know. You also don't have the right to know about: Acetonin: A wonderfully buttery flavor and aroma created by bacterial digestion of certain amino acids. Carmine: A ""natural colorant"", vibrant red, and used in many hard candies... made from crushed beetle shells. Massoia Lactone: A coconut flavor made from the bark of the Massoia tree. Created using slave labor in the third world, and kills the trees that the bark is harvested from... also the Massoia is not a coconut tree. Those are just three off the top of my head. The FDA is currently also allowing many forms of sweeteners to be classified as ""natural sweeteners"" including High Fructose Corn Syrup, Fractured Corn Syrup, Invert Corn Sugar, and various fruit and vegetable sugars like Beet Sugar and Coconut Sugar. The FDA in the US works for industry, not for us, and it's been that way for a while now. They have refused to honor the peoples wish on issues like Truth in Advertising, Meat Country of Origin (along with the USDA) ""Made In"" labels to include processing in other countries (some of your food is processed in multiple companies, and then assembled in the US, and gets a ""Made In America"" label for that) along with lots of other issues, from GMO labeling to defining Organics and Free Range."
"It's better to network to the job you want. That's far more powerful than the school you went to. Things like school name brands and GPA are only ""fresh"" with value for about 5 years maximum. After than it's just: have BSEE, have MSEE, etc. and what's your work experience/area. Some of the absolutely WORST EE's I've ever worked with went to: MIT, CalTech, UCB, Stanford.  And Ivy League engineering degree is pretty much durian. Some of the best come for the first list, also but it's shocking how much cruft graduates from these places.  You get more even, smaller variances in quality from 2nd tier schools. My father was an ME and he swore by Cal Poly grads over UCB grads, for instance. I've seen similar myself as an EE in Silicon Valley: being a Stanford grad is a major red flag and I know I need to dig deeper on technical skills because they tend to lead with ego and bravado. My theory is 1) smaller schools are ""hungrier"", 2) smaller schools focus on what they can control - fame isn't one of those but teaching is, 3) big-name school over-sell themselves on their prestige and research but skimp on quality, and 4) graduates of big-name schools *sometimes* coast once they get in and don't work as hard as they should banking on using the school name brand instead."

"Italy has an independence movement too of the North. In China there would be too if they weren't suppressed. In fact, it's not in the news often, but the Chinese army has to intervene regularly to suppress pretty large revolts. If economic dissimilarity is not a decisive problem to keep a country together, I don't see why it has to be for the eurozone either. Do mind that economies as diverse as Ireland, the Netherlands and Greece all are in the Euro, so the Euro rules offer significantly more slack than being in the same country.  The IMF isn't all that reliable, as it imposes harsh austerity too as condition. In addition, the IMF can't print money, so its funds are limited, while those of a central bank aren't. The ECB eliminates a lot of exchange rate risk and all the middleman profits associated with currency exchanges. It's a prime example of reducing red tape. The problem is the lack of flexibility in the money supply. But there are ways around that, as the example of existing countries show. If we take the argument that the money supply needs to be tailored to the economic needs as guide to create currencies, then most countries in Europe and at least the large ones all need to get their own currencies. Ironically, that would make the EU even more of a necessity since we'd end up with a hundred or more regions that nobody in the international world could tell apart properly."
"Its no problem HavershamSmith. Just know I am a bit biased. Almost everyone here leans a little on something. Just get as much opinions as you can, take that information and dissect it. Form your own opinions and go from there. When purchasing your parts consider the brand, specs, and price.

Not every computer has to be ugly. You can definitely mix and match parts to make it look appealing. For instance going with black and red build with a red led case fans and topping it off with a side window. Even considering what color the PCB is on the RAM or motherboard. Color of cpu cooler... lots of things you can do to make your build appealing. Have fun, hope everything pans out for you."
"Just that GBs usually take a while and might be delayed as well. GMK is pretty safe though, they've done this before.  80% is usually called ""tenkeyless"" or ""TKL"", just FYI. And it's really personal preference. I started the mechanical keyboard rabbithole with a TKL keyboard, but I rapidly started paring down. TKL is nice but it's still pretty large, and I rarely use the F key row and the three keys in the top right corner (Print Screen, Scroll Lock, Pause/Break), although of course they can be programmed to something else if you want. You'll be astonished at how small you can go, but many people want dedicated arrow keys and think 60% is a little small. 65% and 75% are good compromises.  Whether to go with clicky (blue), tactile (brown) or linear (red) switches is also personal preference. If you're unsure which of these broad categories to go with, I definitely think you should get a switch tester. Within those three categories, there are also a myriad of options. Personally I always use tactiles, but within that category there is little reason to use Cherry MX switches. Brown switches in general are not very tactile (kind of like a compromise between tactile and linear), and Cherry MX Brown in particular is a very ""scratchy"" switch, ie. it doesn't feel very smooth. Gateron makes cheap Cherry clones, and the Gateron Brown is well known for being smoother than Cherry MX Brown. I have a board with Cherry MX Clear now, which is the heavier and more tactile version of Cherry MX Brown basically, and that's also super scratchy. Meanwhile, expensive switches like Zealios (they also have linear and silent options) are extremely smooth. So I'd first figure out decisively if you want clicky, tactile or linear, and then so some research within that category to find a decent switch.  U80-A is definitely a solid endgame build! It supports QMK and is great quality.  I hope you're not going to use those blue switches in a shared workspace :)  Yes, you absolutely should go for hotswap. The soldering part isn't really hard, but since you're unsure what switches to get, I would not, under any circumstances, buy a solid board like U-80A just to solder lots of regular-ass Cherry MX switches onto it (unless, of course, I'd tested higher quality switches and knew Cherry were my favorite). Cherry MX makes popular switches but don't restrict yourself to the most well-known brand for an endgame board, I can almost guarantee that's what you'd regret. Yes, you can desolder all the switches and change them later, but the PCB can't really be expected to withstand a lot of solder/desolder cycles. Hotswap is a great feature for a starter board, so you can try out different switches. Especially when your starter board is an expensive ""endgame-grade"" board like this. Otherwise you kinda have to ""lock in"", to some degree, with a switch you're not sure you'll like. And it does sound like you should get a switch tester, to figure out what category of switches you want. Testing a single switch will never give you the same impression as typing on a whole keyboard filled with them, but it's better than going in blind.  I have kinda answered this, but I doubt you'll regret the U80-A itself (unless you find out that a TKL is too big for you). You will likely regret it if you get a non-hotswap U80-A filled with Cherry MX Brown. That's the takeaway I guess."

Post Match Thread [**HERE.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/emfs6e/postmatch_thread_fc_barcelona_2_3_atl%C3%A9tico_madrid/) F.C. Barcelona News: **FC Barcelona Were Crowned ‘Winter Champions,’ But Team’s Stats Are Worst In An Age** Matchday 19 of the La Liga 2019/2020 season was completed at the weekend, which means that we’re are now officially halfway through and that prior to Spain’s Epiphany celebrations on Three Wise Men Day, the country’s winter champions have been crowned. Drawing 2-2 against Espanyol on Saturday at the RCDE Stadium, the honour was bestowed upon FC Barcelona for managing to stay above Real Madrid at the top by a mere +2 goal difference - as had been seen for several rounds of fixtures leading up to Christmas. Yet rather than celebrate the fact that this is the 24th time Barça have achieved the feat in the history of the Spanish top flight, detractors have rushed to highlight that a tally of 40 points is their worst in 12 years at this stage of a season. In Frank Rijkaard’s fatal final term, the Blaugrana were also on 40 points and seven off the chase from Madrid, who then went on to lift their second consecutive title. A decision made that the Dutchman would be relieved of his duties after a demoralising 4-1 defeat in El Clasico, it will be hoped by Ernesto Valverde’s boo boys that the present day manager will also be destined for the Camp Nou exit door based on recent developments. And then, with a bit of luck, replaced by a Pep Guardiola-like figure capable of revolutionising the club from the ground up with a “Tiki-Taka” brand of soccer that claims every piece of silverware in sight. To put things into perspective, FCB’s best-ever haul was in 2012-2013 when under Tito Vilanova, they had notched 55 points by now on their way to amassing a spectacular 100 overall. The following year, on Tata Martino’s watch, it was 50 - the same total Guardiola managed in his maiden attempt. As for Valverde himself, there is an evident decline in progress given that in 2017-2018 his team had 51 points on the path to a domestic double and 43 in 2018-2019. Back in 2019/2020, there are concerns elsewhere too and unsurprisingly they are derived from poor form on the road. All three of their losses thus far out of the Camp Nou, Barça have also fallen a goal behind in six of their 10 away fixtures. Dropping 15 points of a possible 30, then, their record stands at four wins, three draws and three losses overall in these outings while having scored 15 and conceded 13. Pipped by Athletic Bilbao 1-0 in the closing minutes of their opening day clash,  Barça have been soundly beaten by Granada and Levante by scorelines of 2-0 and 3-1. Immediately triggering talk of an internal ‘crisis’, it is only their home demolitions of visiting opposition have steaded the ship. To look further into the draws however, they are representative of one of the squad’s most criticised facets - that it is no longer able to put games to bed. In the 2-2 draws with Osasuna, Real Sociedad and now Espanyol, Barça of course fell 0-1 down, showed resolve and fighting spirit by eventually taking the lead, but then succumbed to equalisers that meant the proceedings finished honours even. Though on the continent away goals would sway heavily in their favour, this unwanted habit is something Valverde needs to rectify post-haste as crunch time approaches. [Source.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomsanderson/2020/01/06/fc-barcelona-crowned-winter-champions-but-stats-are-worst-in-an-age/) *Processing img 9jvk5qud92a41...* Barcelona Training **Distraught De Jong Reaction To Derby Disaster Highlights Level Of Dedication To FC Barcelona Cause** Frenkie de Jong was having a rare off-day. In his side’s first game back since the Christmas and New Year break, the young Duthcman showed the most evident signs of ring-rust as FC Barcelona struggled against cross-city rivals Espanyol at the RCDE Stadium on Saturday. First overcooking a midfield pass to Lionel Messi on the touchline, which was far too heavy for even the Ballon d’Or winner to control, he then tried to play Sergi Roberto in down the right flank but hit the ball into the stands. Gradually finding his playmaking rhythm, De Jong undid any budding progress by piggy-backing on David Lopez to win a header around the 20 minute mark, and therefore gave away a free kick in a dangerous area in Barça’s own half. When a delicious cross came flying in from the left wing, De Jong was found marking thin air and left Lopez free to smash home a header that put the bottom-ranked La Liga strugglers ahead in the tie. It was the sixth time in 10 road trips Ernesto Valverde’s men had fallen behind to their opposition in 2019/2020, further concerning fresh statistics were still yet to be formed. Luis Suarez and Arturo Vidal took the bull by the horns with responses in the 50th and 58th minutes that gave the visitors a 2-1 advantage before De Jong fluffed his lines yet again when receiving a second yellow card with a quarter of an hour to spare and left Barça with 10 men. Spaces therefore opened up for Espanyol to exploit, the introduction of Nelson Semedo for Antoine Griezmann failed to keep the Parakeets at bay and in the 88th minute, Wu Lei bagged the leveller that sank *Culé* hearts. The third such occasion that Barcelona had surrendered a lead away from the Camp Nou after coming back, the 2-2 final scoreline meant that a possible 15 out of 30 points have been dropped when visiting domestic foes this term. And while Barcelona kept pole position over Real Madrid by a mere +2 goal difference on 40 points overall - their worst tally halfway through a campaign in 12 years - the 22-year-old in question was no less affected by his poor display. Evidently wounded when receiving a first career red card on the pitch and immediately consoled by Gerard Pique, SPORT alleges that De Jong was a wreck in the locker room post-match. ‘After the game De Jong was sunken, feeling responsible for the draw in Cornella. \[It was\] his first red card and he knows it could prove decisive in a bad way,’ claims Lluis Miguelsanz. ‘De Jong was sunk in the dressing room and received the love and support of his team-mates and the staff, despite what happened,’ he continues, before writing that the former Ajax prodigy ‘is working hard to make sure it does not happen again’. Additionally, he is also aware that he wasn’t ‘at the right level against Espanyol in a high-voltage derby clash.’ ‘De Jong feels responsible, even though his team-mates tell him he has exceptional quality, is a great teammate and has adapted to the team and city perfectly,’ Miguelsanz explains further. Boasting fitness and athleticism that is deemed to be of an Olympic standard, the reaction also demonstrates an impressive level of maturity from De Jong and is communicative of his unquestionable dedication to the cause. Regularly analyzing his performances with technical staff after games and asking for information on the opposition prior to kick-off, De Jong is said to be ‘never satisfied even after great games’. A revelation after his summer move from Ajax, though, Coach Ernesto Valverde and his supporting cast apparently consider the dismissal an ‘accident’ and ‘nothing has changed’ their assertion that De Jong will be ‘a player who will mark an era at the club.’ The Dutchman now turning the page but vowing never to forget his first red card, it is believed that he will continue to improve because doing so is his ‘authentic obsession’. On his way to Saudi Arabia to contest the Spanish Super Cup, De Jong can set about righting his wrongs by lifting a first piece of silverware for his employers in the final on Sunday after seeing off Atletico Madrid on Thursday.

Barca had dominated proceedings at the King Abdullah Sports City Stadium in Saudi Arabia but conceded two sloppy goals in the final ten minutes to gift Atletico a 3-2 win. Having led 2-1 in the 81st minute, goalkeeper Neto first conceded a clumsy penalty, bringing down Vitolo and allowing Alvaro Morata to level from the spot. Five minutes later, poor defending saw Angel Correa go clean through on goal, before Neto failed to stop his tame effort, which looped off his gloves and over the line. ""We need to try and continue playing as well as we did today for the rest of the year, but make sure we don't make the childish errors,"" Messi told reporters after the defeat, according to Reuters. ""We controlled the game for around 80 minutes, we played at a high pace, we attacked all the time and created lots of chances. But in the last 10 minutes we made big and we let a game slip which we had under control."" Atletico opened the scoring on the night just a minute after half-time, as Koke prodded home from close range following a neat interchange with Correa. Messi had Barcelona level in the 51st minute however — the Argentine impossibly wriggling free from two defenders in the box to slam the ball past Jan Oblak with his right boot. The Argentine then had a goal disallowed for an adjudged handball, before Antoine Griezmann headed home against his former club to put the Catalans in the driving seat. Barca had another goal disallowed in the 73rd minute, this time from Gerard Pique, before going on to lose the match in the closing stages. The defeat continues what has been a poor start to 2020 for Ernesto Valverde's side, having drawn 2-2 with local rivals Espanyol in La Liga on Saturday. Messi, however, is confident things will improve. ""It's normal that there is discontent when there's a defeat and people feel the team is not playing as they would like,"" he said. ""We have to be more united than ever, be a strong group and move forward. We are top of La Liga but we have not been playing well recently so we are going to try and recover our best play so we can stay at the top.""

As a delegation has been in Saudi Arabia this week for the Spanish Super Cup, which Barcelona were knocked out of by Atletico Madrid at the semi-final stage on Thursday, the logistics make sense. Moments after the final whistle blew on the Blaugrana’s 2-3 defeat to Diego Simeone’s men, the same outlet, RAC1 radio, reported that current manager Ernesto Valverde’s situation in the hot seat had become ‘very delicate’ and that his fate could be decided at a board meeting on Monday. Quickly however, the likes of Mundo Deportivo poured scorn on this by detailing how their Barça club sources had ‘categorically denied’ to them ‘the possibility that Valverde’s continuity could have been jeopardized by the defeat against Atletico in Jeddah’. ‘In that sense, they affirmed that president \[Josep\] Bartomeu does not intend to fire him,’ wrote Fernando Polo. ‘The meeting of the board of directors, scheduled for next Monday, has already been set for days according to these sources of the club and has not been precipitated in any case by the defeat in the Spanish Super Cup,’ it was added. Director of institutional and sporting relations Guillermo Amor insisting that there was “nothing” to say regarding Valverde’s predicament post-match, the support of the locker room was also communicated when Lionel Messi remarked in the mixed zone that he and his teammates ‘have confidence in Valverde’. Similarly, Luis Suarez stressed that the players, and not the coach, were at fault for the comeback collapse through their own ‘mistakes and distractions at specific times’. In SPORT this morning, Joaquim M. Bertran declared that these comments ‘reflected what the general feeling of the Barcelona dressing room is about the situation and about the continuity of Ernesto Valverde on the bench.’ ‘Some players have already reached the board of Bartomeu, through different means, \[to clarify\] that Ernesto Valverde must continue, \[and that\] the solution \[to the team’s problems\] does not go through a change of coach,’ he continued, before adding that the staff is ‘convinced that, together with their coach, they will prevent a similar situation \[as occured in Liverpool and Rome\] from happening again this season.’ Since this however, RAC 1’s claims have sent shockwaves through Catalonia and *culé*\-passionate corners of the world. As the club’s all-time appearances leader, who left in 2015 after a fourth Champions League crown, Xavi is also considered one of its greatest-ever players. And while still unexperienced as a coach attempting to find his way at Al Sadd, he would undoubtedly command respect from stars such as Messi, Gerard Pique and Sergio Busquets alongside whom he clinched the sextuple in 2009, in addition to an endless list of silverware during Pep Guardiola’s Tiki Taka dynasty. Like them a product of the famed La Masia academy, he has not hidden his desire to one day take over the reins at the current La Liga leaders. ‘My dream is to go back as Barça coach,’ the former midfielder said to TV3 in June last year. ‘That is my objective, but it's not an obsession.’ [Source.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomsanderson/2020/01/10/fc-barcelona-directors-meet-with-club-legend-xavi-to-discuss-head-coach-role-reports-claim/#5fc47089e08d) [Xavi](https://preview.redd.it/fuesc5jha2a41.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4136c6a6c81a0abcf84f1d4993e7bcc10d5455e)"

They can also check your thyroid function, your blood sugar, and sometimes your current levels of lithium or valproic acid, as well as see how well your heart is doing i.e. to validate if you've had a heart attack recently. &amp;#x200B; Though it occasionally happens via a blood draw, drug tests are more often than not in the form of a urine test.

"My ideas: * Fix the weird formatting indents when copy-pasting * Better autosave and less confusing dialog boxes when trying to recover * Button to clear formatting * Give me Ctrl-A and Ctrl-P! * Allow me to look at flowsheet, labs and write my note in the same screen. * Give me a view to see all the patients I've recently written notes on * Allow Addendums to add stuff in the appropriate places rather than at the end. * Powernotes should let me directly type into the template rather than having to open a new window -- or at least someway to look at flowsheet values without having to close and reopen the text input. * Better clarification between ""Note Title"" and ""Note Type""...or remove the former. * ""ALL"" should be ""All not signed"" in the dropdown on the Powernote tab * Show flowsheet CMPs and CBCs in fishbone form. * Remove wasted space at the top and bottom * Use different color for low/high vals - not just red EDIT: some more: * in-line spell check with medical dictionary * keyword search for a patient's notes * an RSS-like timeline of everything that has been updated for the patient: 1201: pt. got zofran 1234: progress note added 1400: blood cx: negative result"
"Nah, that's like saying Batman can't be shown to stop organised crime rings every once and awhile. One of the core features of most superheroes is that they are advocating change in said world. Maybe Superman and Cap aren't, but Batman and WW do this most of the time. Even Superman pushes for change in Metropolis from the corporate clutches of Lex Luthor (can't tell you how much I enjoyed writing that). And remember that Wonder Woman was *always* a ""subversive"" character by comic-book standards, most usually subverting gender-roles and expectations and turning the whole ""damsel in distress"" mechanism around. In her worlds, girls aren't helpless kittens who need to be rescued, even the non-Amazonian ones. Back in the day it would've been considered ""breaking the conventional rules"" but y'know what? That's how you not stop being conventional. It's not ""ending all war"" or ""all crime"" -- just being against it. BTW, remember what I was saying earlier about her stories being subversive? That was one of the many ways how in her Golden Age stories she was subverting the portrayal of Greek mythology (first age of heroes?) -- by deconstructing / exposing how Herakles' heroism was extremely sexist, how the depiction of Amazons in classical texts was always one-sided (male-identified), and how Odin himself was evil (those were weird times). Not saying this justifies turning Superman evil all the time, but it's like how Batman and Superman, whenever they are in a crossover, Bruce is always subtly subverting Superman with his much-more cynical way of viewing ""the world."" My point (regarding your breakdown of Injustice, which I agree with): Maybe not that extreme, but Superman has been questioned time and again (Snyder does that with pretty much all three members of the Trinity -- I'll explain if you're game, taking this back to the movies).  This is an argument I've been having on another thread before and it isn't true. It undermines just how popular and iconic she is as a character despite the fact that she hasn't had that many solo-projects, adaptations, animated shows, etc. DC/WB keeps saying she's Trinity but never gives her franchise the sort of budget and push that Batman and Superman receive. That ""demands of the market"" argument breaks down when you consider that these are fictional characters and that their popularity is generated. Look at Iron Man, or Guardians of the Galaxy. Not exactly the most iconic heroes before their movies. Plus WW's franchise, for decades, lingered in Hollywood's red-light queue because producers kept saying they can't profit off of a female action hero (when franchises like *Resident Evil* and *Xena* and *Buffy* and *Underworld* kept proving otherwise). To me, that's been a disservice.  Pacifist-driven action-narratives are still part of who she is. The whole action-heavy warrioress angle is tired and done to death. I think a better word is ""anti-war"" because I still think war and fantasy are sub-genres in the superhero CBMs that can do exceptionally well. The MCU, despite Thor Ragnarok, is still mostly sci-fi heavy. Even Doctor Strange is too... shall we say... steeped in a language of theoretical science with the way they call dimension-bending a ""code"" or how they're focusing on ""time"" like it's *The Matrix* or something. Which is why James Wan's inclusion in the DCEU excites me so much."
"No other fast food option even comes close. You can put literally anything you want on it, and it doesn't even start to get made until you order it. Grilled onions, honey barbeque sauce, jalapenos, pepper jack cheese, texas toast, spicy ketchup, patty melt sauce, swiss cheese, chorizo, shit sometimes you can get a fried egg on that thing too. Whatever you want, period. Plus the HBCB and taquitos and red Fanta? Whataburger is top 5 in terms of Texan contributions to the world."
"No, this is not the case, although it's a common misunderstanding. Couple of examples: * 100cc commuter - the most common type of powered road vehicle world wide. A 4s CB100N revs to about 10.5k rpm, and a 2s RS100 revs to about 8k rpm, both giving a top speed of about 60mph. * 350 sports twin. This is a little more difficult as 4s sports bikes are generally four cylinder. 2s RD350LC (RZ350 in the USA) gives peak power at 8.5k rpm, red-line at 9.5k rpm. The contemporary CB400N gave peak power at 9.5k rpm, red-line at 10.5k rpm - this was not a sports bike, but will serve for illustration. I know it's counter-intuitive, but two-strokes don't rev as high as four-strokes in the same state of tune. My guess is that this is because of the convoluted inlet tract through the crank-case. BTW, you may say ""Ah, but everyone tuned RD350LCs!"". Yes, and some of them would rev to 11 or 12k rpm - briefly. But the Japanese were producing inline fours of 400cc at the same time with red-lines between 15-17k rpm, in road tune."
"Nope, doesn’t matter. Phial damage makes up more than 50% of your DPS (for artillery, it’s even more for CB ice). Sounds like you’re missing one or more of artillery 3, focus 3, guard 1, or capacity boost (all of them if it’s the set I think it is). Without artillery your SAED loses 30% of its power, without focus your phials take 2 combos to get to red, without guard 1 you can’t guardpoint properly into SAED, and capacity boost adds another phial, which is another 10% straight up increase. On paper it might have less straight up power, but in performance it’s definitely necessary to have the supporting skills. Affinity is quite literally an afterthought for impact CB. CB ice also needs the same skills, but swaps out artillery 3 for ice attack 5, and you can’t get all of those with Drachen and still hit (near) infinite white."

"OOC: The old introduction got archived, and I've also made some rather significant changes to the backstory. --- Name: Nick (No surname) Age: 20 Godrent: Athena Appearance/Clothing: [Example 1](http://i.imgur.com/kS2XNNn.jpg?1) / [Example 2](http://i.imgur.com/xrZC5gU.jpg?1) / [Example 3](http://i.imgur.com/kAfniLW.jpg?1) His clothing rarely changes. **Skills**: * Enhanced agility, strength and endurance * Extremely difficult to beat in darkness (This refers to him not relying on his eyes so much and also with his training) * Notable is the *lack* of any active powers * Master of [Ninjutsu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninjutsu), in the following 4 categories; the character has moderate knowledge of the other 14: *Taijutsu*: Unarmed combat *Kenjutsu*: Sword mastery *Shurikenjutsu*: Throwing weapons *Kayakajutsu*: Pyrotechnics * A decent guitarist  **Character Traits** * Very secretive, do you know the saying *""Hard shell, soft core""*? Emotionally speaking Nick has a hard shell and a hard core. * Slight pyromaniac traits * Despises flying, likes sailing * Very quick at learning languages **Possessions** * [Katana](http://i.imgur.com/MCBaSnQ.jpg) * [Guitar](http://i.imgur.com/Ww2sPEe.jpg) * [Grapple Hook](http://i.imgur.com/La1IGFe.jpg?1) Usually attached to his left arm **Pets** * [Female red-green Macaw named ""Melody""](http://i.imgur.com/yCLqxgR.jpg) --- Backstory Nick’s mysterious origin never troubled a lot of people, Nick himself was unknown to most of the camps inhabitants and he liked to keep it that way. Simply asking where he came from would be met with a stern look and silence. Even people who could say of themselves that they were close to him never really knew what exactly happened before the troubled man walked across the green hills of camp-half blood. Nick didn’t like to go into details. Truth to be told, Nick was abandoned from the first day of his life when Athena misplaced her trust and sent his father a gift: Nick. His father was a busy businessman who traveled the world and did not have any time for a child, his interest always was money and not family. Fate directed Nick to the steps of a temple who claimed to be peaceful and a follower of Buddhism. The monks picked up Nick, the only message left by his father was in an envelope with only his name in it. The temple was always eager to pick up young people with no past and no future, for the peaceful quietness of the temple was a farce. Behind mediating monks and stone walls there was a clan practicing the ancient art of Ninjutsu. They claimed that there was honour in their ways but they only answered to the highest bidder. Life and death was only a question of the right price. Running a temple was expensive after all. And so young recruits were taught in the ways of the Ninja. Nick never left the temple until much later, which may explain why monsters never bothered to find and kill him. Of the starting 20 only 10 made it to the first examination, for training was harsh and the masters wanted results. With 14 the recruits were sent out on their first missions, accompanied of course. From those missions only 6 returned. Due to his godly heritage Nick excelled at every task given to him. But with his age great change comes, and on his first unaccompanied mission Nick found his best friend. A black young man called Thomas. His parents emigrated and came to Japan, a land which promised lots of technological advancement. Both were strangers to the country even though they were born here, for Nick’s looks were european and Thomas’ colour stood out in the crowd. When not training, meditating or fighting Nick was sneaking out of the temple to adventure the city with his friend. They exchanged wisdom, ancient skills were exchanged for modern knowledge. Technological advancement was quick in such times and it was hard to keep up. Thomas gave Nick a new perspective on the world. Often times he tried to convince him to leave that damn clan and to explore the world. Nick countered that he had obligations to fulfill, things that needed to be taken care of. With 18 the remaining recruits received their tattoos. Symbol of the clan and forever branded so they may never lead a normal life. Nick was missing a lot of times, this was obviously brought to the attention of the leaders of the clan. They put a trail on him and as good of an assassin as Nick was, when with his friend he was distracted and didn’t pay attention to his surroundings. Thomas and his family found their end forcefully and way too soon. Nick realized that what he was doing was wrong on every level and fled the country. When he left the temple with no intention on ever returning back, the monsters picked up his trail. Their attention had been brought to him for a while now but since he was always returning to the temple they kept their distance. Nick’s travels with no particular target led him all the way to Greece, where he met a satyr who finally revealed his full heritage to him and sent him on his way to safe spot: Camp Half-Blood. --- OOC: TL;DR: Nick's tattoos now don't have any special powers anymore, they are simple clan markings. His personality doesn't change though. Reasoning that the only true friend that was close to him died because he made a mistake. ---- *Nick was sitting on the edge of the forest, thinking about his past. Eyes closed he wondered if there was anything else to remember.* OOC: Feel free to interact if you want."
"Ok, this is a long one. Me and a friend were walking through the CBD at about 9 at night, when this guy walks up to us out of nowhere. He's wearing baggy blue sweatpants, a grey hoodie and a large red beanie. He says ""Hey fellas, can I show you a magic trick? I only need a coin."" We had no idea where this was going, so my friend handed him a 20c coin. He showed us the coin, then threw it over his shoulders and shouted ""Voila! It's gone!"" We chuckled and walked away, but this guy followed us for about 20 minutes. And holy shit, this guy was *weird.* Every time a woman walked past us, he'd say ""Hi mum"" or something like that. Told us he was a ""good man"" who'd done nothing wrong. He mentioned being inside Area 51, and talking to aliens. This was in Australia. My friend asked him where he was from, and he said he came from a mental institution. He'd been given free time in the city with a security guard, but he'd escaped the guard. This is the one thing I think might be true. He grabbed my friend's skateboard, told us he was going to do a trick, then he put the board upside-down on the floor and stood on it. At one point, he grabbed a leftover drink from a bench, and threw it at the window of an expensive clothing store. He then turned to us and said ""See that? You do that in Malaysia, you'll get shot"". We only got away from him when he walked over to some random guy and asked for a high-five. We snuck around a corner then ran. As we were heading home, we passed a police officer and told him there might be an escaped asylum patient walking around the city. We gave him a description, then the officer said he'd handle it and left. We never found out what happened to red beanie guy."
"On the Menendez case, the accusations didn't originally come from the NLPC, they came from sources in Nicaragua. And the story that the media ignored was that an FBI investigation was underway. No reputable media outlet would pick up a story from a source as questionable as the NLPC. But no media outlet without an ulterior agenda would ignore a story about a U.S. Senator under federal investigation. And they certainly wouldn't ignore it to focus on another Senator taking an awkward sip of water. MSNBC [replayed that footage 155 times in a single day](http://newsbusters.org/blogs/randy-hall/2013/02/14/msnbc-replays-rubio-water-sip-155-times-one-day-far-more-cnn-and-fox-new) mocking it. Keep in mind, we're talking about a (so-called) reputable media outlet ignoring a story of a federal grand jury investigation on a Democrat while devoting hours to mockery of a Republican. This same day, CNN replayed the clip 34 times, and didn't mention the Menendez story once. In the following three weeks the major networks, (CBS, ABC, and NBC) reported on that federal investigation only seven times in total. In this same period CNN was devoting hours a day to the Rubio story with the caption ""Is this a career-ender?"" (That's a sly trick they use, tagging a question mark on the end of an accusation, so that they can claim that they were just 'asking the question,' and they don't have to take responsibility for the accusation itself. It's slightly lazier than attributing accusations to ""unnamed sources.') These are not the behaviors of unbiased news organizations. These are the behaviors of people who are pushing an agenda, and establishing a narrative. If you really believe that the outlets are unbiased, then why did none of them report or address *what Rubio actually said?* None of them addressed the content of the speech. They told the story of an awkward moment, and suggested that it could end his career. Your claim that the liberals aren't appealing to emotion is absolutely false. It's simply that the liberals are more subtle about it. [Look at the cover of the Huffington Post today.](http://imgur.com/7fQG0rt) Are you really telling me that this isn't an appeal to emotion? Look at the [front page of MSNBC](http://imgur.com/uqprqPk). The headline is ""14 GOP Senators Stand In the Way of Gun Control."" Not that they ""support gun rights."" It's not that they ""Oppose Gun Control."" No, the headline reads that they ""stand in the way."" Then look further to the right, ""Obama's Plea: Put Children's Safety Ahead of NRA."" See? Obama doesn't care about politics, just about the safety of our children. Below that, they play the question mark game again with the Santorum headline, and further below, they report that Mitch McConnell wanted to ""attack"" Ashley Judd. Again, using misleading terminology to paint the Republican as a bad guy. How about [the front page of ABC News](http://imgur.com/7jnOpW0). Notice the story isn't that somebody illegally bugged the office of the Senator. And it's not that he was discussing how to campaign against a potential challenger in an election (an activity that makes complete sense.) No, he was ""plotting,"" and they put that slugline under a picture of poor Ashley Judd looking just too cute and an awkward picture of Mitch McConnell with a stupid look on his face. They could have used [this photo](http://imgur.com/iguS2K8) and they could have said ""strategizing"" or ""preparing."" But doing that wouldn't fit the narrative that they're building, and it wouldn't appeal to the emotions of the reader. That's how easy it is to find the bias. I didn't even have to look hard, I just visited the front pages of three news sites on my lunch hour. But it goes deeper and more sinister than that. Take, for example, back in 2000, when Tim Russert started using the colors Red and Blue to represent Republicans and Democrats, respectively. Did you think that was a random assignment? They didn't pick innocuous colors, like purple and yellow. What's more, they didn't use red for liberals and blue for conservatives, despite the fact that those had been the typical associations since the French Revolution (and in Europe still are i.e. 'Tory Blue' and 'Labour Red.') No, Russert went the other way, presented them to a culture who associated red with 'evil' and blue with 'good,' and, without a word, conveyed those concepts to the American people, a practice that the rest of the media dutifully followed. Yes, we (conservatives) suck at marketing. For too long we've operated under the belief that being right was sufficient, that the people would recognize the wisdom and common sense in our policies, and would join us. And a lot of conservatives have resorted to blunt propaganda not in an effort to divide the country, but in an effort to unite the country in conservatism. We don't want to exclude anyone. Just the opposite. We want everyone to join us in the big tent that is conservatism and, by extension, the Republican Party. But blunt propaganda isn't the real evil. The problem, as I've tried to outline above, is the underhanded propaganda. The most effective propaganda is that which masquerades as something else. Especially if that something masquerades as impartial information. That's why salesmen often present a sale as something else. ""Hey, I just want to talk to you."" Because if you knew it was a sale (or propaganda) you would shut down. That's why liberals are so careful to maintain the image of impartiality while actually promoting their agenda. If the news stations were really impartial, would they have focused on that drink of water? Or would they have focused on the substance of Rubio's speech? They didn't report on what Rubio said, they didn't even report what he said. They gave great coverage to the SOTU, but absolutely none to the response other than to mock the speaker drinking a bottle of water. How is this possibly the actions of a reputable outlet of journalism? Try this test: go to CNN or ABC or any one of the major news networks. Look up stories of corruption and play ""Name that party."" Or better, go to those sites and search for ""right wing."" Just the term. See how many hits you get. Then, search for the term ""left wing."" See how many you get. Far fewer. The members of the media typically aren't intentionally skewing their reporting. What they're doing is reporting what they see as the truth. But what they see as the truth is extremely liberal. So, they present a view, and convince the viewers and readers of the view, that to be liberal is to be center, and to be right is to be extreme. Do it, test those items and let me know how it turns out. I think you'll be surprised."
"Other things I liked from gaijin is that he goes over the weapon in a better order. Speaking from CB perspective at least. Also he skipped some things, like I didn't know I could charge the shield with yellow/red highlight. I thought I had to wait for the bouncing glowing red charge. My play really improved after gaijin's video, and I can say that arekk's video mostly just let me learn the moveset (and even then I think gaijin goes over it in a better way to learn it)."
"Ozil had Ronaldo and Benzema in front of him, of course he was going to look great. But he got 19 assists in the PL last season which was one less than the total record. How you can say he's not been anything but great is ridiculous Koscielny was not even first choice for France until he moved here. I'm assuming you don't remember his first season here but he was dreadful, red cards, penalties, own goals etc since then he has become one of the PLs best CBs consistently Mustafi until recently had never lost a game for Arsenal, before his he was amazing. He has also no lt even been here a season Xhaka similarly has only been here a season, it often takes players a season to adjust to the PL Gabriel was not bought as first choice"
"Ozil turned a player, with a blatant shooting opportunity. Should your CB have seen red for that? I'm willing to bet you wouldn't think so, even though thats the laws of the game."

"People are in love with Worrilow. I hear fans talk about how great he is all the time because of the number of tackles he makes. People claim that the only thing holding Mass back was the fact that he doesn't get enough play time and at the start of last season people were talking about him as the solution to our pass rushing woes and some continue to think he should be starting at DE. People talk about how good our secondary is and how we are set at CB because of Alford and Trufant, but Alford got burned or penalized more often than not. Soliai will probably be okay in a better situation, but is hardly what I would call an impact player. Jackson was never any good as a DE in a 3-4 in KC nor as a DT here. I know our scheme was terrible, I said that I hated Nolan's scheme myself. Ish played pretty damn well as a backup, but he isn't good in coverage and should only be played near the line of scrimmage. Even running a 4-2-5 our run defense was still better than our pass defense. Our pass defense was ranked 32nd in yards allowed despite almost always being in the nickel, while our run defense was 21st in yards allowed. The few times we didn't play the nickel such as goal line defense and in the red zone, our run D still sucked and we were 32nd in number of rushing TD's given up Billick said that before Smith was fired, but the fact that he's Mike Smith's his brother in law is not enough reason to discount everything he says. The numbers speak for themselves and our defense was one of if not the worst in the NFL, and you can't blame that entirely on a bad scheme. Last year we had a plethora of late round picks (4th or later) and UDFA's starting on defense like Worrilow, Bartu, Ishmael, Mcclain, Lowery, Shembo, Soliai, and only 1 true first round talent in Trufant (Jackson was and is still a huge bust for a first round pick). While occasionally you can find a diamond in the rough in the later rounds and UDFA it's hardly the norm and the fact that over half of our defense is made up of late round picks and UDFA, while having only 1 elite player means that our personnel on defense just flat out suck. You can sugar coat it all you want."
"Planetside 2 is a first person massively multilayer online shooter where you fight with your faction for control of bases on a continent. Fights containing more than 24 players per side are frequent and battles of 96 are possible. You will pick a faction to fight for before being dropped into a fight like you've never seen before. These factions and their basic traits are: **New Conglomerate**: The rebel faction of Auraxis, these blue and yellow boys specialise in heavy hitting weapons capable of dropping targets with ease. It comes at a small cost of extra recoil though. **Terrain Republic**: The imperialist army of Auraxis, these red soldiers remain loyal to Earth, even hundreds of light years from home. Their weapons have larger clips and carry more in reserve to provide ammo to the faster firing weapons they carry. **Vanu Sovereignty**: These purple cultists have found the way of Vanu and believe that all who refuse enlightenment should be exterminated. Carrying low recoil weapons with little to no bullet drop, these hippies are to be feared for their ability to put you down at range faster than others. The planet you're on is Auraxis. You came here through a wormhole which suddenly destabilised leaving all stranded for the next 100 years. As time went on, relationships frayed and mutiny was imminent until the 3 factions were formed. Now each fights for control of Auraxis and to eliminate the opposing armies. However that was before rebirthing technology. Now it's an endless war full of subterfuge and brutality.

"Policy cancelation can be from anything. Usually they have a 3 flag system. 3rd warning and your done. Sometimes it takes something really serious (like doing 30 over the limit), or other times it can be for petty stuff (you drove too long without taking a break). 2 examples of this 1) I drove 1hr33 mins and took a 29 minute break. The policy was 1hr30 to 30 mins. Apparently, despite me roughly timing it out, Those extra seconds mattered, got a red for taking breaks for the month, and that was a flag. I called to complain, call centre person sided with me but said it was a computer says no situation. 2) A friend of mine took their car in for some suspension work. The garage test drove it after and the box recorded 15 over the limit. He got a flag, and despite the garage even sending a letter direct to the insurer admitting liability, they refused to remove the flag, and just ""left a note on his record incase it was ever reviewed"". &amp;#x200B; As for 4 policies, 2 were simultaneous, 1 was canceled half way through.

"Post Title: The Biomimicry Color Theory + “Tier” list HEY YO WHATS UP MFA Before I continue, let it be known that this is my first major “contribution” towards MFA, so please take my advice with a grain of salt. Let it be known though, that I put a serious amount of thought into this and spent over 9000 hours in ms paint drawing the graphic that will accompany this post. Let’s begin. Color is perhaps one of the most difficult things to get right for beginners. We hear a bunch of things about dark blue, brown, grey being “basic colors” and very “safe” as far as building a wardrobe goes. That’s why dark jeans (navy blue), cdb in beeswax (brown) and a top like a grey OCBD so invaluable and popular. But have you ever thought about *why* this is? **why** are colors like navy blue and dark brown so easy on the eyes, as compared to something like hot pink or bright green? Why do colors like navy blue and khakis seem to work *so* well together? Let me start by introducing the concept of Biomimicry (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomimicry). In my business sustainability class we learned that many firms draw parallels in business processes with mother nature herself in order to increase efficiency and sustainability. I realized that similar parallels can be drawn in the world of men’s fashion. The reason why some colors are “safer” than others, and why some color combinations just work *so* well together can be explained through Biomimcry. Really! The reason why some colors are inherently “safer” than others is because **they are more commonly found in nature**. Similarly some colors are incredibly hard on the eyes because they exist rarely outside of artificial means, or seldom appear in our surroundings at all. Let me now introduce my “Color danger level” tier list; [http://i.imgur.com/EBSWl.png] **&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; OPEN THIS SHIT** The lower you go down in the list, the more dangerous territory you tread on. Keep in mind when I show a color, I am assuming a few shades of deviations are all grouped under the single color name. Now for a full breakdown of the list! TRY TO KEEP UP! -----*BLACK AND WHITE TIER* – Super special no tier Black and White are very special “colors” in fashion—they aren’t colors at all. Scroll down to the end to hear my opinion on them -----*COMPLETE SAFETY TIER* – Super safe and dummy proof. God Tier Colors. **“Earthy” Browns**: Doesn’t get much safer than this. Brown is seen everywhere in nature—*in dirt, mud, the trunks of trees, the hide of animals, dead leaves on the ground, rocks of cliffs, and shores of sand*. It is perhaps one of the most abundant colors in nature off of sheer variety alone. **Dark/Navy Blue**: Ah, this is a classic. Why is this color so easy on the eyes? Because it’s the color of the god damn ocean. The god damn ocean that makes up 70% of the Earth’s surface. It’s a color that is symbolic with life ON EARTH. **Grey** (and all varieties of it): Can be considered a shade of white/black I suppose, but pure white/black is hard to find in nature. Grey is a very safe color to have in your wardrobe in many different shades. Rocks come in all shades of grey. And rocks are fucking everywhere. -----*SAFE TIER* – still very safe colors, although not as ‘dummy proof’ as the ones mentioned above. High Tier **Forest Greens**: Well you all saw this coming. *Forests, foliage, grass, marshes*, are all green. The earthiest, darkest greens are the best—ones found deep inside the forests. **Dark Yellow/Gold**: Wheat, Sand, the more “golden brown” of nature. *Dying grass, dying leaves*, the shade of yellow that is synonymous with the beginning of the fall season. Kind of on the other side of the spectrum with the earthier brown mentioned before (Khakis would fall somewhere inbetween) but both of these colors are extremely safe to have in your wardrobe. **Sky Blue**: The god damn **sky** son. -----*CAUTIOUS TIER* – possibly dangerous colors, Can look very out of place in certain outfits. Mid Tier **Maroon**: Seasonally dependant, but personally I find maroon a gorgeous color. You really only see this color during the *fall time on leaves* but the color itself is gorgeous. With the correct shade, a deep red can make or break many outfits **Dull/Pumpkin orange**: Seasonally dependant like red, but generally harder to find a shade of “orange” without approaching brown or golden brown territory. Most abundant on *leaves during autumn*. -----*SLIGHTLY DANGEROUS TIER* – I would advise to stay away from these colors unless you know what you are doing. Low tier **Amethyst/purple**: I’ve always thought the color purple is very strange to match clothing with, and rightly so, you don’t see the color purple in nature outside of *certain unique flowers*. That being said, I still think purple is a gorgeous color, but I still don’t own any purple clothing (apart from ties) because the territory is so foreign. The color does appear sometimes in certain seasons during *certain times of the day/night in the sky*, but the color is far from common. **Light/Lavender Pink**: I think light pink marks the boundary line between wearable, reasonable colors and colors that begin to get ridiculous. Light pink works in certain outfits, but you have to be careful or risk looking like a flamboyant try-hard. Once again drawing parallels to nature, you find the color quite scarcely in nature, saving places like Japan which have the *Sakura tree*. *Now onto the fun part. Everything below I would consider dangerous, they are generally not found in nature or found only in very, very specific parts of the world.* -----*RUNNING WITH SCISSORS TIER* – AKA “Kindergarten colors” - Shit tier **Web Ass looking colors**. All colors here are incredibly bold and I would advise staying away from them unless you seriously know what you are doing, or they are accompanied with a very monochromatic or dull outfit. They seldom appear in nature, or appear anywhere at all except in Kindergarten picture books teaching kids about color. -----*LOOK AT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE* – AKA “Furiously Fluorescent” Diarrhea Tier **Fluorescent colors**. Try to imagine these are the “Highlighter” colors you find in your local stationary store. They are bright, obtrusive, and reflect more light then a crossing guard’s uniform. To be honest I would avoid these colors at all costs unless you lived in the 70s. They are also ridiculously artificial, they can’t be found anywhere in nature. -----*FUSCHIA TIER* **Ugly ass pink colo**r- Pretty much the hardest color to pull off. Ever. ------*BLACK AND WHITE TIER*—REVISITED While these two “colors” are not the most abundant in nature. They have the characteristic of being able to fit into any outfit…at certain times. They are both the easiest and hardest to pull off. END OF TIER LIST ---------------------------------------------- -----&gt; *The concept of matching colors* If you see things work in nature, they will probably work on your clothes too. An example I used in another thread was **the beach**. The **Ocean** is navy blue, **ripples** of the waves are white, and the **sand** is golden brown. *White buttondown, navy blue sweater and chinos.* How about a **Tree**? The **Leaves** are a deep lush green, slightly **wilting leaves** are a shade of dark yellow, and the **trunk** of the trees are brown. *White buttondown with a dark yellow sweater, green jacket over it, brown chinos.* **A Field of wheat.** Now you may think an environment like the is would be monotonous..but take in the bigger picture. The **wheat** is a golden light brown, the **soil** beneath it much more dark and earthy, and the **sky** above it is light blue. *Sky blue OCBD, khakis, CDB in beeswax. The MFA uniform.* **Lake inside of a forest**. The **trees** in the forest a lush green, **mountain ranges** in the back a pale grey, the **lake** itself a deep blue, and the **shadows** of the dense foliage black. *Grey sweater, Green jacket over it, Dark blue jeans, and black boots to finish.* DISCLAIMER: Keep in mind this is geared towards people just starting out and looking for a sense of direction while still developing their own style. Obviously there are major exceptions to everything I wrote, people can pull off anything[(dat undershirt)]( http://lookbook.nu/look/4172580-Gnomeo-Visit-my-blog), and even with the most neutral colors, overuse or poor placement can still make everything look out of place. I have not taken different fabric, patterns, seasons, even occasions into consideration so there are still many factors left out of the color loop. However I still feel like this theory is a very good starting point for those of us (including me) still unexperienced. **TL;DR** Imitating nature is how we define whether a color is “neutral” or not. We can also look into nature to find different combinations of colors that work."
"Private alcohol sales are great in big cities that can support specialty shops. Then you get into small towns that 5 shitty brews from big brewers, a ""red"" a ""white"" and fireball whiskey. Everything else is stupid expensive because volumes are so low.  The LCBO on the other hand; everything is the same price everywhere. I'm not going to get gouged at huntcamp because the closest LCBO is the only one within 70km. Live in a small town and want a different wine? They will order that shit from another store, at no extra cost to you. The LCBO provides consistent price, consistent product and TBH a great buying experience.  I'm also really ok with the massive influx of cash the province gets from the LCBO."
"RX is the active diffusion area over which the gate is formed. You can see it on this image in red https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Schematic-view-of-a-7nm-layout-showing-a-single-finFET-and-some-wiring-Fins-yellow_fig2_315305765 The RX width is constantly being scaled down. So its edges are important and there are lots of patents about it. Looks like RXN and RXP are simply the different variants of diffusion areas: P or N doped RX. The CB (and also CA) are additional local interconnect layers. CA is used to route vertically, typically connecting the fins of the same FET together or to make power and ground connections to the transistors. CB is used horizontally within the cell, linking points in the contact layer to the polysilicon local interconnect. The layers sit below the first metal layer and are called middle of the line interconnect. They help reduce congestion on very short routes. They at cheaper than traditional layers because they don't use vias. Here they seem to be using Dutch a local layer set the edges of the RX. GR is used both for the ground rule value and also the generation-recombination (G-R) current. In this context they seem to be talking about compatibility with the old ground rule. It looks like GR is a general term for all the rules regarding spacing of parts."
"Reddit user /u/dalllrious asked for power management tips, so I wrote this guide for everyone. **About Me:** Hi. I'm CMDR WinterCharm. I'm a PVP Pilot with 700+ hours, and also run a Lawful Good group in Elite, called Iridium Wing, and am a friend to many many groups in the Elite Universe. ----------- Here's one of my ships, and an example of power management in Coriolis: (an Elite Dangerous outfitting utility.) [This is my combat Vulture, Mother of Invention](https://coriolis.edcd.io/outfit/vulture?code=A4patfFalddksif32b2b020400045i5i45272525.Iw1%2FkA%3D%3D.CwBhGYzAmaEYGLlIA%3D%3D%3D.H4sIAAAAAAAAA42Qu0oDURCGR5NdN9k1e8nFRQSj2ShYiJaCkDRqJwFfIL5BSgtLC0sfwTKPkNIXENKks1jEIoVFbERQ53dmYQ8SAnqK4T%2Fn%2B%2Bdyhtghom9Lgtv9AsJrCUlaJ8ISd3LkjFeI%2FIMPoBFUBC1zI0d%2Bs0BU8xioj1yiWK%2Bte19MBV43pt4nEGmR2m1VTFMxociHyovK%2BzPhwxcAFh%2FlWaWBVC1rwy1V26raqnayIWzum%2FpXr5L%2FkAL7x%2B9SxOGLHFk30suevQGxNmndTYWX%2FuBlbisXQqQDR8Eu0YYquHxmFvYss%2Fupbk1V3LWJElXw2FuQn%2F16lU%2FM1E8So%2BGlpOpqNnunwgM%2BN1zXGDblw8lgTVDIe6b1o8SKvoaqstUmqhD9Mk2MaWJMqlD9jwk0f34AhAzgIC0CAAA%3D.CwegDCBM4gHDAzApgJwPoBMloDYEMA7AYyRAHUBLAgF1QHIBnAAgBlCSmAKBAShAGZIAVkhA&amp;bn=Mother%20of%20Invention) If you scroll down, and click on the tab that says ""Power and Costs"" you can see what I've done with my power management, so you can follow along while you read. ------------- **Priority 1** Here, we include the bare minimum for survival and movement. * Thrusters - help you get away, they are vital for staying alive. * Power Distributor - let you boost, and cycle power to engines, shields, etc. * Sensors - vital for being able to dock your ship... so you must have them. * Life Support - give your pilot oxygen even if the ship canopy gets blown. * (Frame Shift Drive, if you can). - lets you warp. I did NOT put this in Priority 1 because It would put me over 40% Note: Priority 1 should ALWAYS add up to less than that blue line at 40%. Remember that Elite Dangerous features module damage. People can target, shoot at, and kill specific modules! If someone kills your power plant and it malfunctions, then your power will drop to 40%. Anything above that line will SHUT DOWN. If your ship is not power managed and your plant gets hit, your entire ship will shut down, and you'll be a floating coffin. -------------- **Priority 2** These are all the ""constant running"" things you rely on, which are generally termed ship defenses/utilities. Pri 2 is what should be running ALL the time even if your weapons deploy. * Shield Boosters (x2) - boost my shield strength! * Chaff Launcher (x1) - throws off other people's aim. * Shield Generator - Vital to keeping your shields up. Notice I didn't put this in priority 1. Why? because if your power plant takes a hit, your shield gen is already down/fried. * Shield Cell Bank (Active) - These are little batteries you can ""fire"" to rapidly charge your shield. Generates tons of heat, and uses LOTS of power. * Shield Cell Bank (disabled) - Same as above, but I've DISABLED this one. It's a backup, in case I run out of shield cells in the fist bank, I can turn that one off, and turn this one on! :D Or, I can keep them both on. * Heat Sink Launcher - remember that I said shield cell banks generate tons of heat? well, this guy lets me vent heat immediately. It prevents me from cooking to death :D These are all priority 2. Notice how they are DEFENSIVE attachments. They either boost my shields, or let me throw off people's aim, or vent heat. ----------------- **Priority 3** Weapon Systems Here, I include ONLY weapon systems. When weapons are stowed away, Priority 3 requires NO power. * Plasma Accelerator (x2) - High power / high damage / low ammo weapon. difficult to use, but deadly as fuck (6-8 shot kill on most small ships) ----------- These are modules you can disable if your weapons use lots of power. If you enable my second Shield Cell Bank, then these modules get pushed into the ""red"" which means they shut down during combat for me. So, **when I have my weapons deployed, these things DO NOT work**. When I have my weapons stowed, they work perfectly. **Priority 4** - Stuff that you do NOT need in combat * Frame Shift Drive - since i couldn't fit this in Priority 1, and it's not used it combat, it goes here. ------- **Priority 5** - Stuff that's rarely used, and not needed in combat. * Cargo Hatch - I'm scooping loot after a fight and can stow weapons for that, so, I won't use this in battle. --------- Final Note: this is an intermediate power management guide. There are a few creative ways to get the most juice out of your ship, by getting creative with turning off certain modules, or moving life support to Pri 5 (if you like to live dangerously) and more... But that's for another time."
"Rick Simpsons Site: http://phoenixtears.ca/  Helpful Discussion: http://www.cancertutor.com/hemp_oil/ [most helpful discussion with more links here](http://www.redicecreations.com/radio/2012/10/RIR-121007.php) The biggest issue, and the easiest argument, is that the claims are ""unfounded"" due to the fact that its mostly testimonial only, and not peer reviewed science. Until yesterday there was miles of red tape preventing such studies, but that has changed and we should see the information grow in leaps and bounds now. These links are largely anecdotal, and we cannot claim YET that THC/CBD/Cannabis cures cancer, but it has shown great potential.

"Right, but my question is that there is already one tegu on the list and I'm curious which it is.

"So I bought this Atari 65XE from Ebay. I knew it was defect as the seller clearly stated so, but since I run an electronics repair workshop I accepted the challenge despite I have zero knowledge in this particular kind of computers. Investigating the internals I found a lot of rust on the shields, so that's the first thing I scrapped. The PCB and all components looks OK, no sign of degeneration at all. Verifying the power supply, I can see that its voltage level is top notch, not much ripple or anything on the outputs, so I hooked it into the computer and powered on. Result: red led on computer lit, but the screen is eternal blackness. Power cycling give me reactions on the TV-screen, so the computer is atleast there. And still not. And here's where my lack of knowledge for these computers kick in; I have no idea where to start searching for the error source. I'm very well versed in electronics per se, but not this computer's internals. Does anyone have any tips/points for me as to where to start the troubleshooting?"
"So I received some Cherry Limeade and T1 Trump as an offering when they opened up shop. I guess it’s a family owned business in Wisconsin. Full disclosure, I have not tried the T1 Trump yet. I’m honestly not a fan of low-CBD strains, as I find they don’t do much for me. I’ll give it a shot though! The seal on the packaging was good. I didn’t get any smells. I did not like how prominently the package said “Canna Haus” on it, especially since it wasn’t boxed. I know hemp is legal, but I live in a really red state and we all know the troubles completely legitimate people have run into when LE decides to be dicks. That being said, I did get a letter to LE included, and it was thorough. I would have liked to see labs included. Onto the Cherry Limeade. It was a little dry for my taste. The smell wasn’t overpowering, but I definitely got a tangy, limeade vibe from it. I was pretty impressed even though I wouldn’t call the smell “dank.” Lots of nice trichomes on the bud. The cherry came through when I ground the product up. I chose to roll a j. Overall I was thrilled with the effects! I felt great afterwards. It’s early morning so I’d probably have energy anyway, so I can’t speak to the sedating qualities. I did feel loose, relaxed, and generally happy. I had the sense of heaviness behind my eyelids, but not in a way that made me want to close my eyes. It just felt good. I feel warm all over, and I’d consider it more than a success in that way! I won’t lie, my only selfish complaint is that I REALLY REALLY was hoping to get some sample rosin for some reason. It was never communicated to me in any way and I had no real reason to expect it. I was dreaming big lol. It looks delicious. Anyway, I’d give them a go/10!"
"So I was bored and curious this weekend, why do some keepers perform so much better than others regardless of rating? Keeper is a weird position to fill in FIFA as you cant just place someone else in net like you can a CF as a CAM, you can only use the keepers in the game. But like many of use here, I always have found keepers to be an afterthough in that once you get above a certain rating they are all the same. So I went and looked at the 10 most commonly used keepers in Ultimate Team from Futbin and compared them to the overall stats for all Gold keepers. The top ten were(in order): Lloris  Ter Stegen  Alisson  Courtois  De Gea  Neuer  Areola  Oblak  Ederson  Handanovic In terms of leagues and nationalities, this group makes sense. You have the top leagues in Europe, as well as nationalities that link well to some of the best CBs in the game. They are also fan favorites and play for some of the biggest teams in the world. From this, I took their stats in the six GK stat categories to get an average of the most commonly used GKs. Here is the break down, with the average FUT keeper rating in (): Rating: 88.1  Diving: 87(66.4)  Reflexes: 88.6(67.4)  Handling: 84.9(63.9)  Speed: 53.2(38.6)  Kicking: 80.5(62.6)  Positioning: 86(64.3)  Height: 191.4(181.4) As you can see, the stats match for overall and the most commonly used. Speed seems to be quite low across the board, but reflexes are usually the highest stat for the keeper. From this, I wanted to see how the top ten compare to the average, and right away none are lower than average for all keepers. However, if we look at the stats for the top ten compared to the average top ten stats, patterns begin to emerge. I looked at what stats seem to be associated with each other most often for top ten keepers, and with this I tried to see what stats seem to influence who we select to be in net. For this, I looked at how each stat compared to the average for the top ten. After seeing which stats were higher than average, I looked to see which other stats were higher for the keeper to see what stats seem to be most commonly found in top keepers. Diving and Reflexes seem to be the most commonly above average trait for a keeper in the ten top to possess, and with diving being associated with 3.4 other above average ratings and reflexes being associated with 3.2 other above average ratings. The lowest was speed, with an above average rating being associated with only an average of two other above average ratings. So if you are looking at who to pick up based solely on stats, look at diving and reflexes. Another interesting stat was kicking, it was actually the third highest, with an above average kicking rating being associated with 2.8 other above average stats. I also looked at another factor, the height of the keepers. The average height of all GKs was 181.4, and for top 10 keepers it was 191.4. So aim for a height of 191 or greater when choosing a keeper. So if you take all the stats and place them together, you can begin to look for who the best keeper is in the game and who is overrated or at least is used at a rate that does not fit how they rank in the top ten. Immidiately, the most commonly used keeper appears as a red flag, that keeper being Lloris. At 188cm he is shorter than average, and while his diving and reflexes stats are above average his kicking stats is about 12 points below average and is the lowest of all top 10 keepers. We can also remove Areola as his diving, reflexes and kicking are all below average. His height is above the average, but given that his stats do not match the rest of the top ten I would argue is being used for chem boost more than he is for his stats. So who could we see as the top keepers? Only 1 of our top ten actually is better than average for Diving, Reflexes, Kicking, and Height; and anyone who has played for the past few years would not be suprised to hear this keeper being De Gea. If we remove height as a qualifier, then Ter Stegen would be tied with De Gea. So De Gea an Ter Stegen may be the top two in the top ten, followed possibly someone like Neuer or Handanovic. Your top five members of the top ten most commonly used probably can be listed as: De Gea  Ter Stegen  Neuer  Handanovic  Oblak Interestingly enough, only one keeper in the game has stats higher than the top ten keepers for all categories: IF Neuer. So I think that would make him technically the best keeper in the game. Just an interesting thing I saw.  TL;DR: Best stats to use to decide on a keeper are reflexes, diving, kicking and height. Best Keeper in the game is IF Neuer. See list for best Gold Gks. Overall rating is not enough to go off alone, nor is height or any other single stat. This may also explain why GK chem styles are useless as none raise Diving, Reflexes and Kicking at the same time which seem to be the three stats that matter the most for keepers."

"So there are two things about the socks and the shirt that make this fit fall flat. Shirt: The pattern and the colors. Neither add anything to the fit in a good way. The colors are pretty saturated and are very numerous: 3 shades of blue, yellow, red/pink-ish and even some green. The horizontal stripes don't do anything for the fit either. They make it busy when it could be simple. Switching the shirt out for a white/light blue OCBD, white/grey scoop neck or v-neck tee would make it much more cohesive and not to over bearing in just *one* part of the fit. Socks: essentially the same as the shirt. The colors are saturated and there are a lot of them. There are way more colors in your shirt or your socks than in the rest of the fit. The stripes, again, don't add anything except to be a lot louder, and when they are visible will really detract from the sweet chino/killshot combo you've got going on. Keeping this simple is going to be your best bet. If you wanted to make it more interesting I would wear something like a faded tank with a shirt like [this one](http://danaleenewyork.com/dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/DL_O_grey_003_1_web.jpg) , [this one](http://danaleenewyork.com/dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/DL_Tank_stripe_002_web.jpg) , [maybe this one](http://danaleenewyork.com/dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/DL_Tank_celadon_002_web.jpg) and certainly [this one](http://danaleenewyork.com/dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/DL_O_white_004_web.jpg) or [this one](http://danaleenewyork.com/dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/DL_CH_NAVY_006_web.jpg)"
"So today is the last day of tampering before FA opens. We pretty much know what the market looks like, so here are the moves I would make: STARTING CAP TOTALS Total Available Cap: $167,371,487 Total Team Cap $: $135,969,674 Cap Space: $31,401,813 Greatest Needs: QB, CB/DB, OT, RUSH MOVES 1) Sign Cornerback [Nickell Robey](http://i.imgur.com/Wh2lbES.png) to a 2 year, $4M deal. I know he isn't the premiere CB on the market, but he's 25, he can play the nickel and dime, and a huge AJ Bouye contract does nothing for us in this rebuilding phase (projected at 5 years, $57M [per Spotrac](http://i.imgur.com/Wh2lbES.png)) . I would project our CBs to go Williams/Skrine/Robey, which is not a fantastic trio, but there are a ton of strong DBs in this draft, so a stopgap will work for now. Alternatively, I would give a similar deal to Safety [Bradley McDougald](http://i.imgur.com/0HoWQdc.png). Mickey D has a similar subprime market value to Robey, and as a converted WR, could help limit the over-the top plays that killed the Jets last year. Whichever DB position doesn't get addressed in FA will probably be picked up early in the draft. CAP ROOM REMAINING: ~$29M 2) ~~Sign OT [Ricky Wagner](http://i.imgur.com/bSAiplh.png) to a [4 year, $28M deal](http://www.spotrac.com/nfl/baltimore-ravens/ricky-wagner-12450/market-value/). Wagner has played mostly RT in the NFL, but protected the blindside for Russell Wilson at Wisconsin, so there might be some flexibility there. With a relatively thin OL class in this draft, I think we need to address this position in FA in a way that doesn't lock us in to anything too extreme~~ **afternoon edit: it appears that Wagner is signing with the Lions. As an alternative, Matt Kalil or Reily Reiff are two solid LTs coming off of down years who may be available in the $8-10M/yr range** CAP ROOM REMAINING: ~$22M 3) Sign ILB [Kevin Minter](http://i.imgur.com/fBGmLYH.png) to a 4 year, $10M deal. Minter is coming off a strong year in ARI, and is familiar with Todd Bowles and his defensive schemes. While he doesn't fit the pass rushing need we have, he is a nice compliment to Darron Lee as he continues to mature, and we can hopefully add an edge guy in a draft that is heavy on them CAP ROOM REMAINING: ~$19M 4) Little Moves * An OG @ ~$1M/yr (Gardner, Evans, Bushrod) * A NT @ ~1-2M/yr (Fairley, Golston, Peko) * Orleans Darkwa RB @ ~$1M/yr * Marquise Goodwin WR @ ~$1M/yr CAP ROOM REMAINING: ~$15M  5) *Deep Breath* The Quarterback. As of a few hours ago, we are OUT of the Mike Glennon sweepstakes. The list of guys who fit in terms of age, skill, and scheme is short: * Matt Barkley - a ""scrap heap"" kind of guy who maybe took a few positive steps in relief work/injury subs in 2016. Probably wouldn't cost much, but there's probably a good reason. * Brian Hoyer/Jay Cutler - With the Bears likely to sign Glennon, you figure one of these guys is not getting resigned in 2017. These guys are pretty comparable, with Cutler being the slightly more skilled player and Hoyer slightly younger. The Bears structured Cutler's 2017 deal so they can cut him without too much trouble on their end. I think we could sign Hoyer ~$3M/yr or Cutler ~$6M/yr, but I'll pass on both. * Gabbert/Kaepernick - With the 49ers rumored to be signing Kirk Cousins to a long term deal, part of the Gabbert/Kaep train is likely to be leaving San Fran. Gabbert is an abysmal QB, with a career completion percentage of 56%, and 38 TDs in 43 games. He doesn't throw a ton of picks, but at 171 yards a game, he's not getting us into the red zone frequently. Kaepernick, in addition to being a political distraction, will command a large one-year deal. Not what the Jets need. * ~~EJ Manuel/Tyrod Taylor - Something is smelly in Buffalo. The late season benching of Taylor, claimed to be injury insurance by the Bills, failed to trigger a large bonus incentive in Taylor's contract, so he's pissed. His dead money number is only $2.8M, so he could be cut if the Bills are looking to Manuel in the future. If in the fallout the team moves on from Taylor, we absolutely have to sign him. We can expect to honor a good fraction of his current $13M/yr contract, I would expect somewhere in the $10-12M/yr range. More realistically, Manuel hits the market somewhere in the ~$3M range. I'm not interested~~ **afternoon edit: Taylor appears to have restructured his contract to stay in BUF** * Case Keenum - Keenum is a league veteran who has been mediocre in limited playing time. In his 4 games in 2016 with at least 20 attempts, Keenum completed 66% of passes for nearly 1200 yards with 6 total TDs and 8 INTs. He might be one of the better options still available. With a market value in the $3-4M/yr range, this guy or someone like him is the answer for 2017. CAP ROOM REMAINING: ~$11M ~fin~"
"So today the flairs changed to gibberish for the upcoming halloween ARG. The mods haven't changed all of the flairs, which I assume is so we can remember what they actually are :P A quick pro tip for Firefox users is to use the web inspector, then click the flair to unpack the &lt;div&gt;/&lt;span&gt; class and take the raw text out to copy to clipboard. the altered flair text is in the title of the tags too. That way you won't manually have to type it out :P. Some of the flairs seem like absolute nonsense, but correct me if I'm wrong What I've managed to get so far: Found Fanart = ""WW91IGhhdmVuJ3QgbXVjaCB0aW1lLg=="" = ""You haven't much time.""

It is interesting to note that all Base64 texts refer to time running out, something bad's about to happen, and that ""She"" is deceptive, but the other ciphers take the form of someone trying to fix something.

"So you dismiss the CBO estimates about the healthcare law saving 200+ billion over 10 years? And the estimates suggesting repealing the law will cost over 100 billion over ten years? Because you ""don't buy it"". I'm sorry Brazil has a big problem with corruption, but America's system is, while not perfect, not terribly corrupt either. Changing the litigation process (tort reform) is a red herring and accounts for relatively little waste in the American healthcare system. Here's some info so you can get your facts straight.

"So, I had planned on writing the next Gas Station Adventure story (only two more before the series finale!) but what just happened to me while I was at the store is FAR too entertaining to pass up. Submitted for your approval: Today, I felt like spaghetti. Not physically, but dammit, I wants me some noodles and marinara. So I hove myself off my nice comfy couch and away from reruns of Dirty Jobs, and headed to the local store. Tis a rather large edifice department and grocery store, similar to Walmart but higher class and locally based. As I stood in the spice aisle, pondering whether or not I should get some basil for this evening's repast, I noticed a curious scent. Definitely not the kind of smell you associate with the spice aisle, this was obviously THAT kind of herb. I turn and see a young man, who is obviously HIGH. No, I don't mean that he's pretty stoned, I mean he is HHHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH. He's past the point of thinking he's growing deer antlers. He's so high his component molecules are randomly blipping in and out of existence. He's so baked Betty Crocker could use him as a spokesmodel. He's so blazed I didn't want to approach him without bunker and SCBA gear. Snoop Dogg himself would tell him to tone it down a few notches. [10]^^10 I hope I'm painting an adequate picture here. The dude was really high. I realize that my 5-minute trip to the store was about to go a little longer, because there was no WAY that I wasn't going to follow this guy around (at a discreet distance) and see what kind of entertainment he could provide. Also, I wanted to make sure he didn't try to climb the shelves or something dangerous. He was just high enough to try that. (Seriously, I'm from Portland, I've NEVER seen someone that far gone before). And oh, what a time this young man was having! The look on his face I can only describe as sheer joyous wonder. The same look I assume Neil Armstrong had when he first stepped off the LEM landing pad and made his famous speech. (In fact, this guy was so stoned he may have been there with Neil). Anyway, I wander along behind him as he makes his own voyage of discovery through the wild lands of the Spice Aisle-lands, the steep sides of the Paper Towel Valley, and the deep jungles of Men's Apparel. Here our hero stopped to ponder the ancient mysteries of a red-and-white striped tie, which apparently held as much interest for him as the Rosetta Stone did for Jean-François Champollion. What secrets did it's nylon fibers hold? Unfortunately for our intrepid explorer, a more pressing matter suddenly came to his mind: MUNCHIES. Retracing his rather wandering steps, he found himself in the cracker/cookie aisle, and it was like watching a kid in a candy store. He gently brushed his hands over boxes of Triscuits and Goldfish, stared lovingly at the bags of Milanos, even held his breath in excitement upon finding a treasure trove of Bugles. BUT WAIT!! The Motherlode!! Manna from heaven! Ambrosia! The Nectar of the Gods! CRUSTABLES!! One sweep of his no-doubt-nerveless arms, and a veritable bounty of those delicious snacks were now his. But, that is not enough. Nay, Crustables need a side dish. Away again he wandered, this time heading into the produce area (by this time I'm bright red in the face from trying to hold back laughter) on a mission to find the perfect mate for his self-contained PB&amp;J sammiches. Like a fine gem collector he perused the tables of fresh veggies, until he stopped and reached for a single, solitary source of vitamin B5. An avocado. A smile crept across his face, showing that he was pleased with this bumper crop of nutrition. With only the mildest of wobbles he now headed for the checkout stands. Again I followed 10 yards behind, though I'm pretty sure I could have stood right in front of him in a clown suit, waving a giant sunflower and singing ""Happy Days are Here Again"" and he wouldn't have noticed me. He was now on a mission. Being that it was later in the afternoon, the store is, of course, rather busy. 12 lanes are open, and each one has three or four people in line. That kind of crowd and noise was daunting and confusing to our brave shopping warrior. He stood back from the lines, his body language simply saying, ""Aww, man..."" But hope was rekindled, when he spied out of one very bleery eye the U-Scan area, which was surprisingly crowd free! But here in lies the final challenge. Working the U-Scan. I took my purchases (I had decided to forgo the basil and just use oregano, I know, I'm not very adventurous) to pay my fare and watch the inevitable Charlie Foxtrot that would occur. And occur it did. The machine was as foreign to him as an EKG would be to an aboriginal native of the deep Amazon jungle. Thankfully, the kind and helpful customer service attendant working there realized the young man's predicament, and went to assist. She instantly realized what the situation was, and slowed down her speech so that he could understand what was going on. I'm pretty sure he didn't anyway, but he did manage to put all his valuable victuals into a sack, hand a wad of cash to the attendant, mumble out something extremely unintelligible but was probably a variation on ""thank you,"" and headed towards the exit. I bagged my fixins, stopped next to the attendant to share a laugh, and then headed for the parking lot and my car. The last I saw of him, he was headed off on yet another adventure, this one to points unknown and distances unthought. My only conciliation was the fact that he was headed AWAY from the busy highway, and towards the much lower-traffic roads of the residential area behind the store. I sat down in my car, and started laughing so hard I was crying. Now, it's time to make some dinner. **TL;DR - Safe voyage, yon weary traveler! May the road rise to meet your feet, may the avocado be ripe, and may Spongebob be on in 10 minutes!**"
"So, the narcissistic behavior didn't come out until month 4 of our relationship. Before, everything was fine, however I felt something was off. I'm more of a affectionate person, but with a twisted sense of humor. She, my Narc-Ex was a little cold when it came to affection. I always felt like I had one foot in and one foot out. Except when I was around the dogs or horses. She also had a bad view of sex from what she claimed was a bad experience with an ex. She also came from money, had 3 horses that she jumped competitively, and 3 dogs. She also had a Phd, 3 Masters, and a Ba. However, she was going back to school for a certification in BCBA, but no real job. I should have noticed this red flag, but I've been there while working in education. She also was having hormone issues and had a seizure condition. It started after we got back from a vacation that included staying at a place with my family. She came over one weekend, and was a little cold. Over wine, she said she thought she couldn't be with just one person. That she wasn't the type to be monogamous and that staying with one person with no exit was burdensome. She later apologized and said she had some doubts that she wanted to express. Now during this time, we also didn't have sex. Even before I was diagnosed with a hernia, we didn't do it. I thought it was just because she was busy taking 3 online grad courses. I should have known better. She even said that after I was diagnosed that ""I don't want to do anything for fear I may hurt you, hindering your healing."" Now, another red flag popped up when she talked about her past sex life. Before me she was a guy who was between gender reassignments, another guy who worked the night shift at BJ's who believed he had demon wives, and lived in a house before moving back with her home where she was a sex slave. In hindsight, this should have been several red flags. She also would talk about past sexual experiences, which would eat at me because of the lack of sex. I guess Narcissists have a way of finding the weak spot. During September is when it all went crazy. After I had my surgery, she started acting strange. She first cut me off and gave me the silent treatment. Then after trying to reach her several times, told me to chill and that I needed space with my friends. What friends? She never told me she had any real friends. She had acquaintances she knew through the barn and around town. So I gave her the space and a week later, we met up at a diner where she unloaded on me that that my family had no boundaries and that I can't do a relationship right now because of work and the injuries from riding. She didn't even want people at her house. I couldn't even see the pups. I storm out of the diner where I later get a barrage of texts and phone calls, telling me ""to come back and that if you stayed I would discussed the situation further. That if you understood what I was trying to say."" So I gave her the silent treatment. The texts came. Then she called one me day saying that she was sorry and that she was just confused and had doubts. I think this is called ""trauma bonding"". After a bit, we get back together. I meet up with her over the weekend, it goes well. Then Monday comes where we have a discussion. After she said that her one horse couldn't be ridden anymore, she says we can't be together because of the lack of sex. Hello, it was your idea to put it off and I was one week away from getting cleared. I block her. I decided to unblock after a week after my friends and family told me not to and I get tempted again. This time, with my head straightened out from friends and family, I break up with her. I get sent texts about us and she sends me back all the things I got her with a letter, expressing that I had some agenda and these gifts were not out of love. The last thing she texted me was that ""I hope your dick works for new girlfriend."" While we were going back and forth she said that ""she was perfect."" She lives not too far from me and I'd like to be cordial if I bump into her. I just don't want to be lured back in. I'm just trying to process this whole thing."

"So, what about the CB holding Malone's hand down completely? That *should* have been PI which would've put the ball in the red zone in 1st down instead of a 15 yard penalty. Same end result."
"Some years ago I did a little workshop where I turned people colourblind, and you seem like a person who might be able to help me understand something that I was wondering about, from back then. My friends and I put color gels on safety glasses - we were able to browse different gels with exact wavelength cutoffs - and each gel was chosen so it would cut off one or more of the perceived colors. (so we didn't just choose a red one to remove red light - we found out at what wavelength the eye perceived red, and then chose a gel that matched that). So - the glasses would remove one or more colors from ordinary color vision, and after introducing this to groups of people (3-5 people in a group) we had them put the glasses on, and gave them a large handful of [colored matchsticks](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-I2BhCBxaCys/Tx2D3uRxJvI/AAAAAAAAArA/C6L8Ps-I9yo/s1600/T%25C3%25A6ndstiksm%25C3%25B8nstre+%25282%2529.JPG), and asked them to sort them. Mostly people would sort several colors together, depending on what glasses they had on, and other people would break up their piles, and re-sort the matches, putting some of them with a different color. Once in a while (5 people out of the 80~ish we had) a lady would just sort all of our matches, and mostly we trusted that they didn't cheat. How likely is it that they were all tetrachromats?"
"Sorry to hear this, man. That sounds really rough. Here are my thoughts upon hearing that difficult situation. I know it's a challenging transition at this point in your life, but if I were in your shoes, I would leave that relationship. It's doing more harm than good to your well-being and mental health, so it sounds. There are a lot of variables in play here, and I recognize you have many children, so I don't say this without consideration of such. That being said, this does not sound like a healthy relationship whatsoever (at this point). Maybe it once was, but jesus man, let's review some shit here- Infidelity is a serious relationship issue. For some there are no second chances, and for others it's an issue that can eventually be overcome together as a team. Five times however tells a different story. That's not a remorseful person. I'd be so paranoid of all the attractive, successful men in her life all the damn time. That sounds shitty. But beyond that huge issue, which most wouldn't put up with more than a couple times max, it's just sad that she is cold to you. She's supposed to be your partner in crime, to lift your spirits and support you in you life endeavors and hardships. You're supposed to be there for one another, as warm, compassionate, understanding teammates. People have bad moods and can be rude or cold to one another at times, but to be that way all the time...that isn't someone complimenting your life, that's someone impeding on happy, healthy, functional friendships with your supposedly best friend and life love. Furthermore, not just emotionally, but sexual satisfaction is a huge factor in relationship satisfaction. I mean, it's the one person to fantasize and sexualize, to pamper and satisfy, to crave and love in a way like no one else. And the self-esteem benefits stemming from your partner feeling that way about you are no joke. Begging for sex (in this context at least) isn't a healthy part of the relationship either, and that is simply not fair to you. It's another red flag. The frequency and intensity of the sex doesn't sound like it matches your libido, and I think that's unreasonable. It's not alright. Particularly if she's trying to find her satisfaction externally, rather than showing that attraction to you. She should be one person to send you pictures and words that can stir the fire of fun in a relationship. I can't imagine how challenging raising four children might be, but that is so many shitty variables in play, that I don't know if the children would gain enough from one home environment filled with strife and sadness to balance out separate home environments but a healthier setting a each. If you have depression, which these variables are not going to help (self-concept and self-worth are critical facets of battling depression), you need to seek services for that. The research is clear that the most effective treatment modality is the combination of both psychiatric pharmacotherapy (i.e. SSRIs) with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Each have shown to be efficacious interventions in their own right, no doubt, but the most effective treatments are a little of both. Don't underestimate the power of cognitive restructuring via guidance from a licensed, third-party, objective individual with training in a particular theoretical orientation to help you work on your depressive thoughts and how they impact your emotion regulation and affect. The drugs can also vary wildly dependent on individual neurochemistry, so it can be a trial-and-error ordeal too (and of dosage). They can definitely help some struggling folks though, side effects aside. Also, don't underestimate the impact of your attention dysregulation. The comorbidity of MDD and ADHD is fairly high (also true with anxiety), and you should treat the executive dysfunction as a real beast to battle as well. Your executive functions are higher order cognitive skills based in your frontal cortices (PFC among others) - these skills (e.g. sustained attention, planning, organizing, shifting set/flexibility of thought, delay of gratification, inhibition, self-monitoring, working memory, etc.) are negatively impacted in ADHD brains, and you should seek a psychiatrist for medication and/or a psychologist for a neurocognitive evaluation to learn a bit more about your specific neuropsychological strengths and weaknesses to make better recommendations for how to combat the regular difficulties you cope with in this realm. Also, be mindful of how opioids for your chronic pain play a role. Physical and psychological dependence on opioids can have definite and real impacts on mood, executive functions, sexual functioning, etc. even after developing a tolerance. It may or may not be an issue, I can't say, but just be aware that such can play a role. In sum, you asked what I would do. All those issues aside, I wouldn't be with someone that cheated on me numerous times. That means that person doesn't respect me, and I have no time for people that are supposed to be my everything that don't even respect me, let alone show their love for me. I'd sit her down and have that conversation with her and let her know how her behavior impacts me in such a negative way. You deserve better than that, and your kids deserve a family setting devoid of marital turmoil and strife. Your kids want their parents to be happy, and it doesn't sound like this relationship is doing that for either of you. I'm fine with second chances, especially to save a marriage. People make mistakes. That being said, that mentality has a limit, and 5 times is past that limit for me."
"Start out with down/distance. I chant that shit as the play is going on. Then when there is a tackle I shout the yard line, new down, new distance. Im 90% accurate. It takes time and understanding friends. Then move into terminology. Learn what a Nickel/sub defense is (1 extra CB instead of a LB usually). The Big Nickel is an extra Safety instead of an LB (used to cover dominant TEs). Learn the base formation of you team (4-3, 3-4, etc). Learn where your favorite players are aligned on most formations (chandler jones matching up against the Left tackle). Move onto offense. Learn your WR/RB/TE's Numbers (Gronk is 87, Edelman is 11) Learn the basic formations and what your team tends to do in situations (run on second down? Pass in the red zone? etc). Just try to get a grasp of what you think the team is doing. If you're wrong then you're wrong. Its just part of the fun. Nothing is more satisfying than yelling ""VEREEN UP THE SIDELINE HES GOING TO SCORE ON THIS PLAY"" while he is motioning out of the backfield and you identify a LB in a Man-to-Man look. Your friends look at you like you're crazy, then bam, Brady makes the same read and TOUCHDOWN! I also want to coach some day. Maybe not professionally but who knows."
"Started my first serious shattered world game. Random everything, animal kingdoms, de jure kingdoms and empires turned off (custom titles on), tribal and nomadic only. Generated and regenerated maps until I got what I was looking for: a ""pagan"" religion in the British Isles, with three holy sites in reasonable range (though, lacking a conquest CB for some reason, and with so few temples in the world, I wonder how I'm ever going to get moral authority up high enough to reform). You can read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/f2bbo5/tutorial_tuesday_february_11_2020/fhbzxz7/) some of the things I learned in the process. We are red pandas. Decided to start on Noob Island, because why not. It was a challenge getting things started. I could not get anybody to support me in revocation of anything within my duchy, and my troops simply weren't sufficient to do anything, yet. So I just put my councilors on the appropriate missions, and waited for event troops to appear. Once they did, I got the ball rolling on subjugations. Pretty soon I had what I needed to create a custom kingdom, and had all of Ireland except the northern part, which had fallen to people from Scotland (also red pandas; mostly red pandas in Britain, with a few odd humans). My next challenge was that I was out of money and only bringing in 0.3/mo. I didn't have enough troops to raid anything reliably. I have ""reduced fleet costs"", apparently, but they're not reduced enough to make raiding tribes overseas profitable; I lost of money trying to fix my problem that way. I also tried business focus, but no events fired. So then I switched to Intrigue. With this, I had a bit more success. I managed to arrest a few of my chiefs, and their ransoms brought my treasury back to positive. Among them were my local chiefs; I just revoked and ate the tyranny, then banished them and took all their money (which was considerable). My treasury restored, I could act again. Among my acts was to finally spend all that prestige on developing Dublin. Shortly afterward, one of my vassals took most of the rest of Northern Ireland. After someone died and Elective Gavelkind broke that last bit off, I took it myself on behalf of my vassal. I've also managed to grab a little Welsh territory, and after 25 years was up, I extorted tribute from everyone I could beat. I'm one of the big boys of Britain; the other is the High Chief of Mercia (Ducal). I bought a favor from him (cost me 200 gold, but I was good for it by now, thanks to constantly plotting vassals), and betrothed my 14 year old son to his 14 year old daughter. Hopefully I'll be able to press her claims once her father dies, and eventually bring Mercia under ""Irish"" rule. (Of course, all these names are wrong; I'd have to reopen the game to find all the random names the game generated for this map.) Right now I'm just glad to have a nonaggression pact with him."
"Sure! So we're looking for something casual but classy for cooler weather and frrrrrigid winters, all-purpose wear, youthful but not immature, and most importantly, affordable. Burberry Brit is a very good start.

It's sweeter and richer than Brit, trading vanilla powder for sweet, dark woods. A great fall/winter scent. [Tommy Bahama Men](http://www.amazon.com/Tommy-Bahama-Men-Cologne-Spray/dp/B000P275V0/ref=sr_1_11?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1405011850&amp;sr=1-11&amp;keywords=tommy+bahama) (the old one in the kidney-shaped bottle, not the new fruity one in the flask-shaped bottle, Tommy Bahama FOR Men). It's peppery and woody and warm, unsweet, very manly. Similar to Brit except lacking the rose/powder notes. [Versace The Dreamer](http://www.amazon.com/Dreamer-Gianni-Versace-Toilette-Ounces/dp/B000C1W6TK/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1405012575&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=versace+dreamer) - give this one a full wear before you rule it out. At first spray it smells odd, almost like rotting pine needles and burning plastic, herbal and spicy and weird. But after a half hour or so those notes fade and work to give a kick to a gorgeous tobacco, floral, and dry vanilla bean heart. Utterly masculine, but not macho or brutish like some stuff. [Bulgari Pour Homme](http://www.amazon.com/BVLGARI-HOMME-TOILETTE-SPRAY-RETAIL/dp/B000UI9E8G/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1405012854&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=bulgari+pour+homme): a slightly musty tea scent with classy florals. Fascinating and unique without being off-putting or out-there. [John Varvatos Platinum](http://www.amazon.com/John-Varvatos-Platinum-Edition-Toilette/dp/B00C69IJM4/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1405012970&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=john+varvatos+platinum+edition) - another nice woody that works great in cool weather with a business casual attire. Dark and semi-sweet sandalwood. I am a fan of the entire Varvatos line and his nose of choice, Rodrigo Flores-Roux. They make fragrances that are simultaneously modern and classic, classy but not dated or stodgy. Also try John Varvatos, John Varvatos Vintage, and John Varvatos Artisan Acqua.

The skin-saltiness of myrrh and labdanum carries a soapy vanilla/amber/floral heart. As with most of the Prada line, it's a bit abstract and chemical-y but in a good way. As always try before you buy. I'm making some assumptions about your style and taste recommending these."
"Syriza didn't do anything, because they were non-stop in negotiation and implementing any policies would be considered bad faith by the Trojka. It didn't last because the Trojka suddenly started talking tough again and started questioning their credit lines again. Of course people and businesses stop buying and investing, and hoard their money again until that threat is gone.  They don't, they have a primary surplus. It can't recover when it has to send its surplus (4,5%, that's a huge profit, even for steady economies) to outside countries instead of investing it in their own economy.  Which they have been approving for five years, and now suddenly they disapprove when a leftist party comes to power? How coincidental.  The current situation *is* the result of five years of austerity.  There's plenty of blame to go around. Greece cooked the books, but the EZ finance ministers looked the other way. Greece kept a high debt, but the banking crisis forced them to support private banks, catapulting them in the red zone. Greece came in trouble on the bond markets, but the EZ and the ECB refused to acknowledge that an emergency liquidity mechanism was lacking until the damage was done. Greece didn't comply as well as they could, but the Trojka imposed reckless austerity as moral punishment rather than the shortest way out of crisis. Etc."
"TBH it was easier to learn CB by watching speedrunners. There is like 4 combos you need to remember and maybe 6 if you get advanced. That is certainly harder than SnS which has 2-3, and the guns which have 0. But considering how short the combos are, I found CB to be easier than expected to pick up. 1. Phials empty: hold B &gt; Y (charges phials) 2. Phials are red: RT+B (fills phials) 3. Phials full: Y+B &gt; Y+B &gt; Y+B &gt; RT (charges shield) 4. Monster is open, shield charged, and Phials full: Y+B &gt; Y+B &gt; Y+B (fat deeps) You just do 1-2-3, then repeat 1-2-4 until shield charge runs out."

I go whenever the rivalry game is at the Coliseum but pretty much all of my friends from high school went to USC (we have a really strong pipeline there) as have several lovers so I've been to a number of tailgates and games, usually against Stanford but one time against Cal and once against Notre Dame. I usually dress in an innocuous light red (but never full on ketchup, er crimson) unless I'm decked out in Bruin gear for the rivalry and the students are quick to offer you a drink.

"Taking away the options to do different things after a guard point is more of a nerf than a balance IMO. This was the biggest thing that I enjoyed about CB. And its funny because if you regular guard you have the option to either which to axe or charge your shield. Also I still don't understand why CB does stun damage. If something needed balance for CB the first thing would be the stun values of impact phials. These changes basically feel like the developers were upset people were using axe mode as much so they decided make S&amp;S mode to be undesirable. Then decided to further nerf it because adept style needed some use. If this was really more of a balance I would expect to see 1. Heavly nerf/preferablty remove stun from impact. 2. Impact phials account for hit zones and no longer do direct damage. 3. Compile the mutliphial burst from Ultra into 1 burst and have it set off at the same time of impact. Also change the 2 hit 99+100 slash to 1 hit of maybe 150% or so. SOOOOOOO many times I would aim the attack, actually hit where I wanted to but the slashes caused stagger so my phial burst missed. 4. Elemental CB ultra and Impact ultra (hopefully raw because no more stun) have the same phial burst animate. The elemental one SUCKS because A) you can't have precision with it because its a fan movement. and B) it comes out delayed compared to impacted. 5. Make sword more attack values weaker. The charged A move is too strong. 6. To possibly use AED in AXE mode more, since they have a huge problem with it,would be to simply make the AED cost 3 phials instead of 1 and boom, people would use axe more because of higher cost. This could also pair well with how load up works now. See for me CB wasn't about damage, It was about the options a guard point gave you. All of these nerfs basically take the choice away Guardpoints weaker which, to me at least, was the forefront of this weapon. And no Adept guard is not as good as guard points overall. The only good thing about it is that you can charge phials faster and hit red shield faster but it doesn't flow like MH4U guard points did. I feel like all these peopling saying CB has been ""balanced"" didn't understand the weapon and only saw it as a KO powerhouse."
"Team: [](/CIN)**Cincinnati Bengals** -------- Record: 10-5-1 Division: AFC North | 2nd in AFC North (3-3 in Division)  Coach: Marvin Lewis Offensive Coordinator: Hue Jackson Defensive Coordinator: Paul Guenther ----------- **Statistics** ======== Category | Total | Average Per Game | League Rank | ---- | Category | Total | Average Per Game | League Rank ---|---|----|----|----|----|---|---|----|----|----|---- **Offensive** Yards |5568|348|15th|----|**Defensive** Yards Allowed|5749|359.3|22nd Passing Yards|3421|213.8|21st|----|Pass Yards Allowed|3888|243|20th Rushing Yards|2147|134.2|6th|----|Rush Yards Allowed|1861|116.3|20th Points|365|22.8|15th|----|Points Allowed|344|21.5|12th Interceptions Thrown|17|1.06|24th|----|Interceptions|20|1.25|3rd Giveaways|26|1.6|21st|----|Takeaways|26|1.6|29th **Summary:** This is a team that was unremarkable in terms of point and yardage differential, but which managed to win a lot of games anyway. We could point to blowout losses weighed against close victories to explain all this, but the team did have its own blowout wins (@Cleveland Fighting Johnnies, vs. TEN, @NO), and some of the losses were closer than the scoreboard indicated (both PIT games). Bottom line: This was a weird team, and we'll need more than summary statistics to explain what went right and what went wrong. ------------ **General (2014-2015 Recap)** ========= **2014 Offseason** * The Cincinnati Bengals lost both major assistant coaches following the 2013 season, with OC Jay Gruden taking the head coaching gig in Washington, and beloved DC Mike Zimmer doing the same in Minnesota. Hue Jackson and Paul Guenther were hired from within as replacements. * Andy Dalton was signed to what appeared at first to be a massive contract extension. Under further review, most of the potential money is tied up in bonuses and incentives, but this was a major signal that the ~~Bengals' front office~~ Brown family is confident in the red-headed media lightning rod. * The Bengals were quiet (even for the Bengals) during free agency. The team allowed OT Anthony Collins and DE Michael Johnson to get big contracts in Tampa Bay, while restricted free agent and fan favorite WR Andrew Hawkins got an offer from Cleveland. The Bengals didn't match the offer, and Hawkins signed with the cross-state rival. Cincinnati felt the loss of each of these players throughout the 2014 season. 2014 Draft Pick | Player (Position) | Recap -------|--------|---- 24| Darqueze Dennard (CB, Michigan St.) | There's a common debate over the merits of drafting for need vs. drafting the best player available. It helps when one player fills both. Cincinnati was in need of a young DB, but they reportedly had Dennard listed at 8th on their big board anyway. This was an easy call at No. 24. 55 | Jeremy Hill (RB, LSU) | For the second consecutive year, Cincinnati drafted a running back in the second round. Hill was brought in to add a prototypical brusing runner to pair with 2013 rookie speedster Giovani Bernard. 88 | Will Clarke (DE, West Virginia) | Clarke is physically gifted, but was drafted as a project in the third round. Not much is known yet about his ability to produce at the pro level. 111 | Russell Bodine (C, North Carolina) | In an *extremely* rare and surprising move, the Bengals traded up in the draft. They landed Bodine, who was almost immediately tagged to be the starting center for 2014. He has some more development to do, but he's a decent player. 164 | A.J. McCarron (QB, Alabama) | The NFL draft media predictably had a field day with such a consistent collegiate winner being drafted by the Bengals, who are often thought to be stuck in mediocrity at the quarterback position. But Andy Dalton was nearly just as successful in college in terms of win percentage. McCarron is a backup until actual evidence suggests otherwise. 212| Marquis Flowers (OLB, Arizona) | Some didn't see Flowers as a draftable prospect, but the Bengals grabbed him in round 6. Was able to get some regular season snaps on defense. 239| James Wright (WR, LSU) | One of the pleasant surprises of this draft, Wright was a minor contributer when the team found itself in a tight spot in the wake of several WR injuries. Not bad for a seventh-round rookie. 252| Lavelle Westbrooks (CB, Georgia Southern) | Westbrooks failed to make the 53-man roster  ------------ **Season Summary** *Written by /u/the_glutton* * Preseason general notes: The feeling during preseason was that this was a championship-caliber team. Jay Gruden was “lost” to the Redskins in the offseason, and sadly, Mike Zimmer became head coach of the Vikings. The defensive unit now faced questions under new leadership and lost personnel. Hue Jackson made a lot of fans happy with an offensive plan that seemed geared towards a more well-rounded offense. Ravens (W) – Great season start. We dominated defensively and Hue Jackson showed quite a change of pace in offense design. Dalton to Green is unquestionably the play of the game. Tyler Eifert goes down with a dislocated elbow, and while initially designated to return, it will be the end of his season. Vontaze Burfict goes down with a concussion. This theme, unfortunately, continues later. Falcons (W) – Can we copy and paste this team into every game? All phases won, and won big. Giovanni Bernard has a classic Gio game (:3), and Jeremy Hill scores his first touchdown. Mohammed Sanu throws an absolute bomb of a TD pass to a double-covered Brandon Tate. The defense dominated. Burfict goes down again with a concussion. Storm clouds begin to gather, but DOESN’T MATTER BENGALS WON. Titans (W) – This game we dominated and everyone was aboard the Bengals hype train. Sanu threw a touchdown pass to Andy Dalton! Bernard ran in 2 touchdowns! Hill ran one in too! After this week, everyone thought the Bengals were pretty much invincible, until… Bye Patriots (L) – Under the bright lights, we folded, and The Patriots showed up. The best thing said about the offense that game was that Andy Dalton wasn’t terrible. The less said about the porous defense, the better. The Patriots had a lot to prove coming into the game, and they certainly proved it. Panthers (T) – A nailbiter that went into overtime, forcing the league’s only iie of the year, after Mike Nugent missed a 36 yard field goal on the final play of the game. A.J. Green was inactive for the game, but Sanu was a leader on offense, along with a fantastic 89 yard run by Bernard. Colts (L) – In what was one of many notable low points of the season, the Colts shut out the Bengals 27-0. The most that can be said about the defense is that Carlos Dunlap played a solid game. In game recaps, Huber’s punting ability was noteworthy, if for no other reason that there were simply so many other negatives. There was simply put no positive news on offense this game. Ravens (W) – A good game to bounce back from the absolute assault from the Colts. Bernard and Burfict went down with injuries, Bernard would eventually make his return and pave the way for Hill later in the season. The Ravens tried to come back with a last minute drive, but a OPI call on Steve Smith brought the Ravens late momentum to a halt. Jaguars (W) – The Hill legend was born in this game. 153 yards, 2 touchdowns, and let’s not forget about Sanu. It was a great showing by the Bengals if somewhat sloppy. Browns (L) – Thursday night prime time game that ended up being a nightmare. Perhaps Dalton’s worst showing of the season, not even clearing 75 yards passing, the offense simply could not get a rhythm or anything approaching it going. The most positive thing to come out of the game was the presentation of the check for over $1 million to brave Leah Still for pediatric cancer research. Saints (W) – Beginning a 3-game road stretch, The Bengals looked dominant. Dalton led the offense to a 3 TD passing performance and another 150+ yard game from Jeremy Hill. The goal line stand in the 2nd quarter was a reminder of the talent on the defense, even with the injuries throughout the year. Texans (W) – A.J. Green had a career-high 12 receptions in a win at Houston. J.J. Watt was mostly successfully contained and the defense played a solid game against Ryan Mallett. The defense racked up its third safety of the year. Buccaneers (W) – In what was otherwise a poor showing, the Bengals managed to eek out a win on the heels of a not-officially-sanctioned challenge flag. Marvin Lewis flashed some brilliance by calling out a 12 men penalty on the Buccaneers, halting their final drive and destroying their momentum. Dalton threw 3 picks and there weren’t really any offensive leaders, but somehow they hung on for the win. Steelers (L) – The Bengals kept this game competitive until the 4th quarter, when the Steelers offense steamrolled the Bengals with 24 unanswered points. Dalton put up among his best numbers of the season, over 300 yards passing with 2 touchdowns; unfortunately the defense simply eroded in the 4th quarter. Le’Veon Bell was a terror in this game. Browns (W) – In what was a big headline game all week. Johnny Manziel made his professional debut against the most dominant performance by the Bengals defense of the season. Hill again ran a dominant game with 148 yards and 2 touchdowns. The defense showed up, completely shutting out the Browns, redeeming the awful week 10 showing. Broncos (W) – With a playoff berth on the line, the Bengals as a whole played their best game of the season. The defense was able to intercept Manning a total of 4 times, with a big kudos to Dre Kirkpatrick. Hill again dominated in the rushing game with 147 yards and 1 touchdown. Steelers (L) – The AFC North champion would be crowned in this game, and as good as the Bengals looked against the Broncos, the same team did not make the trip to Pittsburgh. Dalton threw for 243 yards, but was intercepted twice, halting offensive momentum. Even the steady Green racked up a rare fumble, on clearly what was not the Bengals best performance. Hill again put in a solid performance with another 100 yard game. The Steelers made more plays, and the Bengals were forced to accept a wild card spot, meaning they’d travel to Indianapolis for Week 18.  ------------ **Playoff Appearance** Colts(L) - Without its top four receiving options, the Cincinnati passing attack was immobile. The only thing the Bengals could do on offense was run the ball, and eventually the Indy defense began to sell out against the rushing attack. Jeremy Hill and Giovani Bernard, behind a quality offensive line, couldn't move against a Colts defense that knew what was coming. On the other side of the ball, the Bengals' defense simply couldn't keep up with Andrew Luck. The unit started the game well, holding most Indianapolis drives to field goals. But as the offense continued to go three-and-out, the defense wore down. The Bengals were once again eliminated in the wild card round of the AFC playoffs. *Continued in comments*"
"Thanks, also I've been trying the aerial CB just before and really liked it, but I can't seem to get the shield thrust to work, nothing happens when I press X+A. My axe doesn't glow either, do I need to be in yellow/red shield first?"
"That's why he's sporting records regarding fouls and red cards? It's not just a longevity thing either. Look, I think that he's an amazing player and even now still one of the best CB's in the world. However, saying that he doesn't have a track record for consistently doing potentially harmful fouls is just disingenious and frankly ridiculous that you are asking me for ""examples""..."
"The CB-80 (CB=Check Bunny) is the latest single battery mod from Wismec that is capable of MTL or DL vaping out of the box. **Disclaimer:** *This product was sent to me for the purposes of review by Wismec. I review all items for a minimum of 2 weeks daily use and do not embellish my opinions. Experiences are based on the mod received, how I vape, and may not be representative of all of the produced same devices.* *Note: I’ve been vaping for 4 years. My vaping style currently varies between RTAs and RDAs, 24-26g Kanthal and SS316L typically between 40 and 70 watts on regulated mods. In addition to the mod reviewed I’ve been using* --- ##**Appearance** [Album](https://imgur.com/a/EzcCQqK) The CB-80 isn’t a bad looking mod. It has nice angles to it with contrasting black to break up whatever color you get it in. It’s small in my hand and definitely smaller than the Espion Solo. The Wismec and CB-80 logos are laser etched onto the sides. The included tank is the same color as the mod and matches pretty closely despite some subtle finish differences. A green honeycomb 510 drip tip was included and it’s thankfully a typical 510 tip and not an 810 at the top and 510 at the bottom. The mod has quite a bit of plastic and the metal part is thin. The result is a lightweight mod that feels less durable than most. It also heats up quite a bit when you switch to the DL coils or an RDA. There are two green LED lights on each side of the mod. They aren't very large and are only green. --- **Function** **How it works** - Very simple no frills operation. 5 clicks on or off. 3 clicks to access the menu, which just switches modes. Wattage mode works well, bypass mode is alright, TC on an RDA is alright. The mod fires quickly which is a nice plus that I always enjoy. 510 has been sturdy and given no errors during me use. No fluctuating resistance readings either. **Armor NS Pro** - My sample kit came with 2 MTL coils and 2 DL coils but the retail kit only comes with 1 of each. The tank itself only has one airflow slot and is adjustable from 3 small holes for DL to a large open adjustable slot for DL. **MTL** - I first tried the MTL coil and it was fairly decent. I didn't experience any leaking and used this coil for two weeks and 30ml of Blue Dot Vapors Spring Honeysuckle Salt liquid with no sign of coil weakening or burning. **DL** - I’ve since swapped to the DL coils. They aren’t quite as flavorful, but still decent. The downfall of DL mode is the 2ml tank and single battery. I refill this tank 2-3 times just while I am at work and typically the battery is dead at that point. Running 5 watts through a small coil in a small tanks results in some heat that transfers to the mod and the drip tip. It’s manageable but I would reserve DL mode more for travel, or short term, and not as an everyday thing. I've put over 50ml through a coil though and it's still going strong. --- **Pros** * Good appearance * Lightweight * MTL and DL options for the same tank * Small size * Well protected screen * MTL battery life * No frills menu and operation **Cons** * DL battery life * Mod heats up with DL vaping * Tank size for DL * Only comes with 1 of each style coil * 18650 only --- **Summary** The Wismec CB-80 is a small, lightweight, single battery mod that does MTL Nic Salt vaping quite well. It’s no frills in terms of the screen and function but it works. For DL vaping via the included coils, or a rebuildable device, it’s less enticing. It heats up quick and the battery drains quickly as well. The tank is an exercise in compromise. It works well for MTL but not as well for DL. Good flavor and longevity in MTL, average flavor and small capacity in DL. Sadly you only get 1 of each coil so if you’re buying this to primarily use 1 mode you need to shop for coils immediately as well. I appreciate these mods that work like pod systems but have a more traditional mod setup. --- More information on the CB-80 can be found at http://www.wismec.com/product/cb-80/, it is available in red, blue, black, orange, and dazzling, and can be purchased for $52 as a kit or $40 for just the mod."
"The KO nerfs to super AED were nessassy though they were really really light. Should have out right removed KO ability. The motion values may have been a bit high. I didn't delve deep in compaing CB damage to other weapons but the motion values should be nerfed before and more heavy than the phial damage. The drastic change to GP was completely unnessassy and ruined the weapon for people who enjoy using GP and playing defensibly with the weapon. If they wanted to nerf the GP&gt;AED they can easily just make the phial requirement 3(or 2) phials and only having 2 or 1 will result in 2 or 1 phial explosions instead of 3. Also SAED on impact was not that good compared to just using AED because the cost was too much. The only reason why it was OP was because it dished out 500 KO; enough to KO all monsters on a single successful hit for their first KO. Which refers to my first point that KO should of have removed completely. Another nerf should have been to removing the ability to combo from regular guard, which was not removed in Gen but has limited options when compared to 4U. And maybe leaving you in axe mode after an AED.  did you play CB solo or just in a party, because its not a brain dead weapon. Timing GP; thinking on whether you should go for an AED(most the time) , axe swing, side step or continue guarding; maintaining you red shield buff. There is more to think about than just GP-&gt;AED. If you're in a party or 3+ maybe not, but that simplification happens to every weapon in a party.  adept style trys painfully hard to give back GP without having them chain to AED. But my main issue with adept is that the GP themselfs don't combo. you have to wait for you character to enter the idle positon before you can attempt to GP. In 4U you do not have to wait this short duration to do a GP. I feel it makes for more fluid and aggressive play. Also it just hurts that Gen offered 4 ways to play a weapon and none of those are the original (in play style not damage. Nerf the hell out of the Motion Values to make it the new gunlance but don't nerf GP fluidity)"
"The article pointed at that as one of the big two hindrances for fostering a start-up culture. We noticed that before, of course, and it was and still is one of the big motivators behind the EU. Our startups will have trouble enough already dealing with all the different languages and cultures... so let's uniformize at least the laws. The culture is worth keeping, the law is just a tool.  We can hardly expect it to arise from the sea in all its perfection. It's a work in progress, and will remain so for a good while.   Because its hands are tied. 9 times out of 10, the problems are caused by necessary agreements being blocked by national veto or sovereignty concerns.  It's quite possible to reform financial systems (and bankrupcy legislation, perhaps) to make investing in startups (and starting over with the lessons learned) a more normal option. It's a necessity to make the cultural change happen IMO.  Reform may just as well *reduce* regulation and mandate greater independence of operations... At the very least uniformization would cut down the different regulatory environments and red tape to a fraction of what it is now, even barring other reforms.  We should consider that. They are enjoying a monopoly of money distribution already anyway (the ECB only lends to banks), and that gives them almost guaranteed profit.  Somebody has to put the axe in the excessive legislation, and indvidual countries aren't going to do it, and even if they do, you just end up with 28 separate regulatory environments again. So coordination is necessary."
"The exception is Voyager, which was actually filmed in 16x9 after the first season, but because UPN was such a red-headed, bastard, step-child after CBS and Viacom merged, they didn't get HD as originally intended."
"The first article you linked to mentioned a data set and then didn't link to it (which a red flag to me). It linked to the site's about page. The 2nd article is about the public's view of the media. It's not an objective study, it's a subjective study. I like the other article much more (it actually linked to the study). It's interesting to the see the industries are so polarized. Would Fox News be considered part of the liberal media industry? If they can descend from the standard, isn't it also a possibility for CBS with this new show?"
"The information is good (it's from a coach's notes on how to run the fade route off the goal line), but you need to practice it a lot in order to get used to it. I typically end up going spread on the goal line with a scat back just in case they leave the run wide open, or run curls with the receivers (which is great for the red zone, but requires excellent timing). Maybe in Madden it requires more user control, or you actually need good receivers (I tend to have shorter receivers in my offenses who can't jump over the CBs)"
"The one big red flag I immediately remember about Mullen was that when it came to our school it was offering all their internships as unpaid ones. Which I understand if you're a smaller mid-sized agency, but other IPG agencies like McCann, R/GA and FCB were there as well and we're offering paid internships with no hesitation. When I went and brought this up to the recruiter, she treated me as if I didn't deserve a paid internship. She worded it that you need more experience first before they decided to put you on the payroll. It was odd, because as I'm sure we all know, interns in agencies are usually just considered Jr. Jr. Talent due to the work they do and how many hours they put in, so it was such an old school way of thinking that left a bad taste in my mouth even years later."
"The red flag on that play call for me was that they expected Kearse to jam Browner into Butler at the line, knowing full well that Browner probably saw that exact play before in Seahawks practice in previous years, and is also a huge dude that is not easy to move. I think the play works against almost any other CB in the league, but the combination of Browner's knowledge and size gave him the upper hand."
"The school board did respond in the previous [CBC article](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/red-deer-lake-school-letter-class-size-1.5089716). They did not deny what the parents' are claiming.  I'm curious as to why this approach is being taken. Why not address the same concerns that the group of parents have? I think you're right that there is more to the story but I feel like the school board is probably taking the approach of ""I'm sick of your bitching, shut up"""
"The silly font choice is to prove how good their silly juice is, the yellow glow stands out among other lights. People are used to big red glows, and as such, tend to look past them without noticing them. A big yellow glow is something people aren't used to, and would probably look at just out of curiosity. The name is straight and to the point. People know what they're getting. There's a 0% chance someone would drive by the store not knowing what it was while looking for alchohol. They see the name liquor, they know they can get some alchohol in there. What kind of name is LCBO? If I had never heard of that before and I was looking for a liquor store, I sure as hell wouldn't check out a store named LCBO. It's good design."
"The team tried to trade him for two years, from the moment Chip showed up. He was not young, he only had the career year because Chip made the most of him (and kept him healthy with sports science), and he was wildly overpaid.Jackson has always been bad in the red zone, can't block, is reluctant over the middle and disappears in the playoffs (as he just did again). He also yelled at his position coach and shoved another coach on national TV after refusing to tackle a CB who intercepted his pass, and believe me teams notice that stuff. No one is going to trade for a player who is overpaid on a non-guaranteed contract, because they're either stuck paying him too much or they have to cut him and still lose their draft pick. After he was released, Jackson took a 40% pay cut, and Washington will probably cut him again because that is STILL too much money for a one-trick pony whose trick (speed) is declining with age, and is increasingly injury prone."
"The top middle boosts on Marble actually do have a lot of interesting choices about it that makes it feel a bit more free than most of the other boosts. When running through the map though, a lot of them felt punishing if you missed them slightly, so I made an [edit](http://unfortunate-maps.jukejuice.com/static/previews/7527.png) to it to illustrate how to make them feel a bit even freer than they already do and a little less dangerous while still having risky paths to it. I've drawn out some of the most important boost routes on my edit [here](http://puu.sh/hPsCB/430c964999.png). The red boost routes are more or less unchanged and were just as acessible before as now. The black ones are the new ones that have opened up or significantly increased their accessibility. This isn't to say you need to edit your map to look like this, but just a way to illustrate that you do have powerful boosts in your map designs already, and what you need to do is try to identify where they are (even if you haven't put the boosts down on the map itself yet), and try to adjust the map around it to give players that sense of power they like without making the boost itself overpowered."
"The two modes for CB are not dependent on each other. Axe is dependent on sword but sword is not dependent on axe. Well it was that way in 4U but in gen you can only get red charge (sheild bash phial charge) in axe. The concept of the weapon is to heavily integrate counter. Guard points and adept guard both do this. Your description of how the weapon should be used is valid for both gen and 4U. Guard points in gen are crap and do not fulfil that task. Regular guard does more in the vein of 4U guard points than gen guard points. In gen you are locked into w/e animation you were doing for gp. If you regular guard to can sidestep, switch to axe, charge your sheild, or do nothing. You still need position for gp-&gt;aed if you want to hit a specific part. Ever try hitting deviljho with gp-&gt;aed. One of his moves you will most likely miss but gp-&gt;axe mode will hit most all the time. you lost me on how gen Guard points have more versatility than 4U."
"Then I call bull. The ""proof"" of the big bang (which isn't proof, it's evidence and the big bang best fits the evidence. If we come across something that fits better we will revise our theories). Which is found by measuring the red/blue shift of other galaxies and using it to map the direction and velocity of their movement - that's astrophysics. Using the data points this generates, we can get a pretty good idea as to where the ""center"" is - also physics. Then, from the fact that the oldest thing are all at the edges of the universe (quasars, specifically), and that the MCBR is present absolutely everywhere, and we know that the universe was once very small (because the MCBR is omnipresent), and that at some point, an event occurred that caused it to explode. Now tell me where that involves economic theory in any way, shape, or form, because it doesn't seem to me like it does."
"There are a number of shortcuts you can take to open up the speed at which you get through Central Yharnam. There are three gates you can unlock now, and one that will have until midgame. 1. From the lamp going right, if you go down to the street and turn left, you unlock the first gate; this is something of a faux shortcut that really only prevents a dead end from forming. 2. From the first gate, run all the way through the mob area—up the stairs to the left of the bonfire and through the archway. There will be a house with a red lantern ahead. To the left of that house are some destroyable boxes, and after you've destroyed them, you can jump down through a hole in the fence. Kill the mongrel dogs. Back and to your left is a house—open the door, kill the two residents on the bottom floor, and exit the house by the second door on the bottom floor; there will be an axe-and-torch Yharnamites up some stairs. Kill him and pull the lever to activate the second gate. **(This shortcut allows you to bypass the upper section of the sewers.)** 3. Go back to the area where the mongrel dogs broke out of cages. Go across the bridge and down the stairs, killing the rat-man on the stairs and then the two rat-men + blunderbuss Yharnamite on the ground. Do not jump down to the sewer level. Go out of the building, go down the ladder in front of you, and run to your left. You will reach a platform with a ladder down, and a ladder up. Take the ladder up. Go to your right, ignore the troll, go to the next ladder up (to the right of the troll) and activate the lever of the third gate. **(Gascoigne's daughters live in the house beside this gate. Speak to the younger daughter to get the music box.)** This gate leads back out to the plaza where you dropped down to the mongrel dog area, which is on your right. To your left will be a pathway towards the sewers' upper level. TO REACH THE BOSSES: 1. CLERIC BEAST From the lamp: enter gate #2 on your left, go into the house, and go up the stairs. There will be a stairway on your left, leading out to a bridge. Go up it, and turn left. Run through the arch in the distance and continue advancing to trigger the boss fight and gain Insight. TIPS: CB is very large, and while its attacks aren't _slow,_ they are very predictable, and that makes them easy to dodge. CB is weak to fire and serrated weapons. (The Saw Cleaver, Saw Spear, and the transformed version of the Threaded Cane are the serrated weapons you have access to.) The head is the weak point—if you do enough damage to it, you'll get a free Visceral Attack. It has a grab attack that is very deadly—do not let it hit you. 2. FATHER GASCOIGNE From the lamp: enter gate #2 on your left, go through the doors. Make like you're going to the ladder that leads up to gate #3. When you get there, take the ladder down on your left. Run through the sewer level and ignore the enemies. There will be a ladder to the right of a tunnel in front of you. Take the ladder up. On your left will be an elevator—this will be your shortcut back to this area in case you die to Gascoigne (or others) but you need to get on it &amp; send it up in order to activate it for later use. Go back down the elevator, and then you have a choice. 1. Go across the bridge. The Yharnamites will go after you, and a troll will light a rock on fire before rolling it towards you. Do not get hit by the boulder. Run across the bridge, ignoring the troll &amp; a shield/torch Yharnamite as you turn left. Go up the stairs, and go up the stairs on your left instead of fighting the rat-men on the right. A cinematic will play before your fight with Gascoigne. 2. Go back down the ladder. Go into the tunnel. Run past the Maneater Boar—in the back area is where you'll find the Saw Badge (which unlocks the Saw Cleaver, Threaded Cane, and Hunter's Axe for purchase in the Dream) free for the taking. Turn around and on your right—or your left, if you ignore that backmost room as you bypass the Maneater Boar—will be an exit that the MEB can't fit through. Go up the ladder in front of you. This ladder leads out to the area beside the shield/torch Yharnamite &amp; troll. Go left, then go up both sets of stairs. Fight Gascoigne."

"There was one point where Monreal passes to Alexis just past the halfway line then sprints towards QPR's box, this is after the red card and I laughed when he turns around and jogs back when he realises he's a CB not a LB"
"These are really good! Especially if you're at a stage where you're just now experimenting with stations. The Hypercoaster is a bit typical, but they all kind of are in reality. The only things I might change on it are the color scheme (it's a little harsh), and I'd make the MCBR long enough to fit the whole train on. It has high negative g's, which usually means you're going over hill(s) too quickly. Maybe you could make some of them taller to improve your ratings? I do really like the overbanked curve over the station. Gaze of the Gorgon reminds me more of *Hydra* at Dorney Park than *Medusa*, just because of the pre-lift inversion. I really have no complaints about it, other than the blazing red of the station walls (not a big deal at all). Behemoth is enormous. Like, Son of Beast enormous. I like some of the double-downs you have, and it just looks really out-of-control. I don't have stats to look at, so I can't see what could be improved there, but it's probably not too severe. I might extend the layout after the MCBR, though. You have a LOT of track before it, and only a couple hills and a helix after it. Try to make it so that the MCBR is actually in the middle of the course (with respect to time, not distance). I like the launched steel coaster (as updated elsewhere in the comments), though I would probably give similar advice here as I gave for the hyper: extend the brake run at the end so that the whole train can fit on it. And the go-karts are awesome. I loved that course, but almost forgot about its existence before this."
"These is a brief recount of my time at $clinic. The IT dept consisted of the IT director, CB (rhymes with bunt boss) myself, OHDG (old help desk guy) DGSA (douchebag ""Sys admin"") and CSA (cool sys admin). I can't even begin to relay how badly the department is run/setup. We just lurched from one catastrophe to another. Everyone is a local admin because our medical software that runs everything requires write access to the local HDD and our sys admins can't figure out a way around it. This will be important later. Also missing: imaging. Need to reload a computer? Get the win 7 disk out and get installing! And at the end, 3 pages of very complex bespoke customizations to get everything running. Shoot me. We had 2 Ad Tran routers that connected our internal phone system to the POTS line (i think, telco is not my area of expertise). Every few days one of the routers would need to be reset, how did we solve this issue? point a webcam at it, and when the red light came on the Ad Tran we reset it. Ask me about the time I almost quit my job over a computer mouse. Right.... Moving on.  **Catastrophe 1.** Our ""SAN"" was a raid 10 without a hotswap. CB's bosses reason for this as far as I can remember is that if a drive died we'd be out of production while the spare rebuilt anyway. right.... So the obvious happens, HDD dies. Fine, we can rebuild him, we have... what? we don't have a spare hard drive? Order it from Texas? fuck shit stack! So new HDD goes in, and another one dies during the RAID rebuild. Fuck shit double stack. Queue 3 days of downtime, a new SAN, a migration and lots of overtime. **Catastrophe 2.** So I'm sitting at my desk staring out the window, kinda windy today no? That power line looks kinda low. (insert Michael bay sized explosion with lots of sparks as a Semi truck hits the low hanging line and takes out 2 poles causing a transformer to explode.) Well no worries, we have a backup generator and a 4 or 8 rack mounted UPS's. Whats that timmy? the cooling system isn't on the generator circuit? and we need to grab all the fans we can to cool the server racks? ruh roh. So the power to the core switches and servers are on the generators, but nothing else is. Swing and a miss. **Catastrophe 3.** Remember how i said everyone was a local admin? Well once computer located in the clinic has full access to the internet for reasons known only to CB. In addition everyone has access to almost all of the network shares. So i'm sitting at my desk minding my own business when i start getting calls that people can't open files on the network shares. Interesting, so i pop open the shares and see some new files, whats this? Ransom instructions? As you can probably guess it starts with Crypto and ends with everything getting shutdown, us finding the offending computer and literally pulling it from the network. Not much was encrypted, we went to tape backups anyway, however a few hundred MB was uploaded... somewhere? Hooray HIPAA violations!

"They didn't get fucked. If it weren't the call (which was weak) they should've called PI for the CB holding his hand which would've put the ball in the red zone instead of a 15 yard penalty. It sounds shitty, but they came out ahead because of that call as opposed to a PI."
"They tried to claim at one point they had a copyright on Peter Pan. No, not just their movie, *all* Peter Pan. My favorite cartoon in the afternoon lineup back in the early 90s was ""Fox's Peter Pan and the Pirates"". Very different interpretation than Disney's: Peter had messy brown hair instead of straight red, wore brown instead of green, coonskin cap instead of green with a feather. Tinkerbell was more frumpy flower than sexy dragonfly. Every character was designed very differently from Disney's interpretation, and the storytelling had a very different feel, as well. And Disney took Fox to court over it (this was back when they were still new enough to be considered an ""underdog"" company in a market dominated by the likes of CBC and ABC). On what basis? Because apparently the fact that they made *one movie* based on a story that had been out of copyright for years (except in the UK, apparently), they now owned everything Peter Pan. Or at least were big enough and intimidating enough they could usually convince someone to settle before getting to court."
"Thirty-eight hours later and seven hundred kilometers to the southeast, Marisol Gutierrez followed the rest of the migrants, jumping down from the back of the panel truck. The only light was a dim red glow from a light held by one of the coyotes. ""Border is that way,"" he told them, sounding bored. ""Go west when you're past the fence. West only, North and east is a big road, lots of Border Patrol. Small roads to the west, no towns."" Marisol made sure her water supply, formerly two bleach bottles, were tied down tightly before heading for the fence. Once she'd climbed the homemade ladder up and over, she looked around. The only light was a dim glow to the east, probably the freeway lights around Langtry. She helped a woman down off the ladder. It slid up and disappeared as the coyotes pulled it back over the fence. The woman thanked her and Marisol nodded and smiled before starting to walk away. ""You're going the wrong way,"" the woman said. ""We're to go this way."" ""I'm meeting someone,"" Marisol said. ""Go with God."" ""Good luck,"" the woman called. She headed east, following the others. Marisol took a couple of deep breaths before jogging to the northeast. She'd been going for about twenty minutes when she began to see headlights crawling across the night. She stopped and drained one of the water containers then used a knife to cut open the side. When it was opened, Marisol pulled out the plastic package that had been taped to the bottom. By the time she got to shoulder of the road, she had a hijab wrapped around her neck and her British papers in her pocket. She had gotten a different shirt out of the bottom of the other bleach bottle and then buried the leftovers under a pile of rocks. The secret weapon was the small plastic packet in her shirt pocket. Seeing the glow of headlights beyond the next rise, Marisol opened the little envelope. She dipped her fingers into the envelope and took another deep breath before running a finger coated in habanero oil under each eye. ""Shit!"" she yelped, waving her hands in front of her watering eyes. Whoever set this up had some explaining to do. She waved her hands in front of her eyes and walked out to the shoulder of the road. Unbuttoning her shirt a couple of buttons, she pulled the hijab over her head and started trudging down the road. A white SUV passed her, one with a green stripe on the fender. It made a U-turn and pulled onto the shoulder in front of her. She saw a government license plate on the back as two men got out. She sniffed, letting the tears run over her cheeks as they both shone lights on her. ""CBP agents,"" one of them said in Spanish. ""Do you have identification?"" ""What are you saying? Doesn't anyone speak English in this bloody country?"" Marisol said with a strong West London accent. The agents looked at each other. This wasn't one they'd heard before. ""Ma'am, where are you coming from?"" one of them asked in English. ""Oh, thank God! He just left me up the road and bloody drove off."" ""Who did, ma'am?"" the other one asked. She could see him looking at her semi-exposed cleavage. ""I thought he was nice, he seemed nice on the internet when we met. But then I flew all this way to meet him. He didn't look like his picture and wanted to do…things. Awful things. When I said no, he just left me beside the road."" Marisol quavered and wiped the tears away from her red eyes. Both of them looked uncomfortable as a line of snot dripped from her nose. ""Uh, do you need a kleenex?"" one of the men said, as it ran over her upper lip. ""Thank you, that would be very kind."" She sniffed, pulling it back up into her nostril. Both men visibly flinched. Now they weren't sure whether she needed comforting or hosing off. ""Ma'am, who left you?"" the other agent asked. ""His name is Charlie Jones, we met on the internet. He works at the Laughlin base and I came all this way to visit him and then he…"" Marisol buried her face in her hands and sobbed. ""Ma'am, what kind of things did he ask you to do? Were you hurt?"" ""I wouldn't like to say, it was very perverse. The only thing I recognized was a leather riding crop."" The agents looked at each other again, fighting back smiles. ""What's your name?"" She took the box of kleenex from the other agent and wiped her eyes. ""Thank you. I'm Atiya Hakim. I'm English."" ""Do you have identification Atiya?"" ""My passport, some credit cards. Can you help me?"" ""Sure we can, can I take a look at your passport?"" Two hours later they were dropping her off at a hotel near the tiny Del Rio airport. Marisol traded numbers with them both and promised to keep in touch before going inside to get a room. *Too bad Atiya is disappearing,* she thought. *The dark haired one was cute.* Still, she was definitely going to have a talk with whoever did travel arrangements. They owed her first class after this crap. ~~~~ In Juarez, a vicious looking thug waited on the sidewalk in front of a bodega. Everyone around him looked away except for the unfortunate few that had to hurry past him with quickly muttered apologies. He ignored them, ignored everything around him except the traffic in the street. Finally, an El Dorado painted a metallic orange- flake pulled to the curb. The thug firmly pushed a passing man out of his way and went to the side of the car. After trading a couple of sentences that everyone was careful not to hear, he climbed in and the car pulled out with a screech of tires. ""Nice ride,"" the thug said in English. ""I'm Jonesy."" ""Call me Ishmael."" Jonesy rolled his eyes and the other man laughed. It was an old joke around the Teams. ""This the car we're taking to the border?"" ""Nah mate, this one's a bit of the dog's bollocks up there. We'd have Buckley's chance of going unnoticed by the Seppos in this. Get a clean donk waiting, you'll be home before a sparrow farts."" Jones looked at the obviously Hispanic driver. ""Sydney? Seriously?"" The other man grinned. ""Yeah, parents moved there right after I was born. Got recruited by Arclight Southern. Sounds like someone up the ladder is well and truly farting sparks Jonesy snorted. ""Obviously. We got pulled off in the middle of a job with no warning."" ""Definitely a rush job from up top then. Guess we'll be headed wherever you came from. Nice place?"" Jonesy watched Juarez go past outside the passenger window. ""Not too bad. But most of my team is still in place."" He glanced over at the driver who was staring at him. ""They split your team? Phew, that's evil juju mate. Your operations section must be chewing the loco weed."" Jonesy nodded gloomily. ~~~~ After school, Theo waited in the truck while Junior, ever the social butterfly, spent some time talking to his friends. He finally got in the truck, ignoring Theo. He was happy for the silence and watched out the window as they headed out of the tiny downtown. Junior parked at the intersection where he usually stopped briefly to drop Theo off for work. ""What's up?"" Theo asked. His body was tense, hand already on the handle for the door. He watched Junior's face but didn't see any of the tells that Junior was about to explode. Still, he kept his hand on the handle, ready to jump. Junior outweighed him by a hundred pounds at least and working the farm meant there was decent muscle under all that fat. The last time they'd gotten into it, Theo had barely been able to walk for a week and being bruised up wasn't an excuse to miss chores at home or at work. ""Why'd you do that?"" Junior asked, still staring out the window. ""This morning I mean. When you told her she oughta hire me."" Theo shrugged slightly. ""You're sweet on her, right? I figure you talking is gonna be easier out on the field. She's always got Sophie and Elizabeth around her at school, I doubt they'll be out there setting seedlings."" Junior finally looked at him. ""What about you being sweet on her?"" ""How many times I gotta tell you? I ain't sweet on her. That's other people talkin'."" He watched Junior, still not seeing any rage. Just confusion. ""That mean you're gonna help me now?"" Theo nodded. ""Much as I can without putting myself forward. You know what happens when someone tells Brother Elmer I been doing that."" ""Yeah, but you been good lately. You ain't been beat but once this year."" Theo shrugged again. ""Learned my lesson. I gotta get going Junior, tractor's gotta get fixed before I can turn over the field."" ""Go on then,"" Junior said, putting the truck in gear. Theo opened the door and hopped out. ""Hey, Brother Runt,"" Junior said before Theo closed the door. ""I ain't saying I need your help but thanks."" Theo nodded, surprised. That was the first thank you he'd ever heard. But Junior still spun his tires as he pulled away, kicking up a cloud of dust around Theo. He wiped his face as he began walking toward the distant barn. ~~~~ Forty-six miles to the northeast, Marisol was getting out of a beat up taxi at an even more decrepit looking motel. The parking lot was full of beat up trucks mostly but there were a few sedans here and there. A bunch of kids were playing on the balcony on the second floor, watched over by a couple old women. Two old school buses, sloppily painted white, were pulled into the lot at the back, dropping off a large crowd of Latinos. Marisol headed for the office as the workers headed for their rooms, greeted by the shouts of the children. Marisol stepped into the office, dark after the bright afternoon sun. ""Ain't got no rooms available,"" a man called from the back. ""My cousin has a room here, I don't know which one."" ""What name?"" the manager said, shuffling out from the back room. ""Emiliana Garza."" He nodded. ""Yeah, got here yesterday. Two-eighteen, stairs around back."" Marisol nodded and walked down the parking lot. There were a lot of curious looks, especially from the groups of young men. A few of them called out remarks that would land them on the wrong side of a sexual harassment charge at most jobs. For a moment she wished she'd worn something sleeveless, the muscles and tattoos on her arms usually bought a little bit of quick respect. But they were playing spy so Marisol just laughed and called back insults that were more teasing than angry. Laughter followed her around the edge of the building as she climbed the stairs. She tapped on the door of two-eighteen, calling out for Emiliana to let her in. The curtains twitched as someone looked out and then she heard the sounds of the door unlocking. Inside, Jonesy and another man were sitting with their backs against the headboard, throwing cards at a hat on the dresser. The woman that opened the door had long dark hair that draped over one shoulder. Her skin was nearly the same color as Marisol's but the shape of her nose and slight epicanthic folds around her eyes indicated more of a Pacific Island heritage. ""Kawehi!"" Marisol whisper-shouted. The two women hugged tightly. ""How've you been?"" Kawehi asked. Marisol grinned at her ""Got a promotion to Chief Sergeant. How about you?"" ""Good to see they're finally appreciating you! But I got bumped up as well, you may call me *Lieutenant* Moana."" Marisol put an arm over Kawehi's shoulder. ""I thought I might have finally caught up."" ""With me? Please,"" the other woman said and they both laughed. ""Meet my Warden, Nate Jackson."" The man beside Jonesy got up and shook hands with Marisol. ""Good to finally meet the legendary Marisol Gutierrez. I've heard a lot about you."" ""She made everything up but the dirty stuff,"" Marisol said. ""Hiya Jonesy."" ""Hey boss. How was your trip?"" ""Unbelievable, I came over with illegal migrants in the middle of Texas. Whatever this little adventure is, it's completely screwed the timeline down in Oaxaca."" Kawehi looked a little embarrassed. ""Actually, that whole op is on pause while Nolan's gang gets down there. The rest of your team will hand things over and start working their way up here."" ""What the *fuck* are they thinking?"" Marisol snapped, fury blooming behind her eyes. ""We spent *weeks* getting everything ready."" ""Nope, time to relax, boss"" Jonesy said as he hopped off the bed. ""Have a drink and catch your breath."" He offered her a bottle and she had a swallow and then another. It was rum, a very welcome change from the raw pulque they'd been drinking. She held the bottle out to Kawehi who shook her head. ""That was out of line, I apologize,"" Marisol said. ""We've been in the field for way too long."" She pulled off her long sleeved shirt revealing a form fitting vest covered in pockets. She unzipped that halfway and sat against the headboard. Jonesy put the cap on the bottle and sat next to her. ""I'll apologize first,"" Kawehi said, pulling the one chair in the room over. She sat down, putting her feet up on the bed. ""You're both here because of me."" ""How's that?"" Marisol asked, taking a bottle of water that Jonesy offered her. ""I asked for both of you specifically."" Marisol looked surprised. ""And they let you? We were in the middle of something big."" ""I know Mari and I wouldn't have done it if I didn't need you. As for letting us, well, the colonies tend to give Commonwealth teams whatever they need to get the mission accomplished."" ""If only to get us off their worlds as quickly as possible,"" Nate added. Kawehi gave him an exasperated glance and he shrugged slightly. Marisol noticed the exchange and, despite her irritation, found herself liking the guy a little bit. ""Anyway,"" Kawehi said. ""I know the broad outline of what you were trying to accomplish but this is bigger. The request came from the Big Leather Chair herself but since we're back home, there's obviously a lot of interest coming from the Commonwealth upper management. So I needed the two best students I ever had."" ""You were always blowing sunshine up my ass,"" Marisol grumbled. ""Whoa, what? I didn't know anything that interesting was going on,"" Jonesy said. Marisol elbowed him in the ribs while Kawehi gave him a withering look. Nate just laughed. ""What's the real reason?"" Marisol asked. Kawehi grinned at her. ""Because the three of us can pass as Latinos."" ""That sounds a little closer to the truth,"" Jonesy said. ""And we *are* Latino, thank you very much."" Kawehi glared at him, looking like the instructor he remembered. ""So what's the game, Kawehi?"" Marisol asked. ""It's a snatch and it needs to be done fast. Yesterday if possible. So the three of us are going to do initial recon. When the rest of your crew shows up in a few days we'll be able to roll on the op."" ""Kay, that's way too fast,"" Marisol said. ""We’ve already been in the field for three months. Snatches need specialized prep and planning. What's so important it can't wait for a prepped team?"" Kawehi smiled. ""You're gonna love this…"" ~~~~ Nate was sitting in the middle of the floor meditating when the door to the motel room opened. Kawehi sagged into the room and flopped down on the bed. Marisol was behind her and began pulling off her work shirt. Jonesy came in a minute later and rummaged in the cooler. ""Don't stink up those sheets,"" Nate said to Kawehi as he unfolded himself from the lotus position. ""You are a beast,"" Kawehi said, eyes closed. ""I haven't worked that hard in a long time."" ""Even I'll admit that was a long day,"" Marisol said. ""Would you like the shower first?"" ""So you don't stink up the sheets?"" Nate added. Kawehi sat up with a small groan. ""I was wrong, you're both a beast and a bastard."" ""You hear the way she talks to me?"" Nate said to Jonesy. ""It's that legendary Warden bond,"" Jonesy said, opening a beer. Kawehi went and got in the shower. She closed her eyes, leaning on the wall and letting the hot water run down over the sore muscles in her back. The door opened and closed but Kawehi didn't open her eyes. Something very cold pressed against her arm and she jumped. ""Doctor's orders,"" Marisol said from the other side of the curtain. ""Ooh, shower beer."" Kawehi took the cold bottle of beer and sighed happily. When she came out of the bathroom wrapped in a towel, Marisol and Nate were gone and Jonesy was sitting on the bed. Kawehi shooed him over and sat against the headboard next to him. ""Where did they go?"" ""To buy pizza because I won the bet."" ""What bet?"" Jonesy looked smug. ""I bet the boss I'd find the kid first."" ""What? There weren't any gringos around except that blonde girl."" ""You didn't see the other group planting in the back field. There was a kid with black hair and blue eyes. And I mean really blue eyes."" ""Did he look like Emma?"" ""Only seen pictures of her, but definitely the same eyes. And there was a big bubba looking kid with him, keeping an eye on him I think. Gotta be him."" Kawehi sat up, the towel slipping open. ""Are you 'sending an email' sure?"" Jonesy handed Kawehi her tablet. ""It's him."" A few minutes later, an email was sent through the motel's internet connetion. It was in Spanish and talked about the working conditions and the pay. In New Mexico, Jeff was about to turn things over to his deputy and get some sleep. They stopped talking as his computer chimed. Jeff immediately sat down and opened it. ""What's up?"" the deputy asked. ""They found him. Let's get messages to her crew."" Another message went out, a tweet this time. Watchers saw it and immediately more messages went out . The format varied, SMS, email, tweets, and brief phone calls pretending to be the wrong number. ~~~~ Ten hours later in Acapulco, a couple on their way home from a honeymoon caught a flight back to the states a couple days early. The wife hadn't been careful about what she had eaten. She was pale and sweaty and the customs officer shook his head as he waved them through. Gringos didn't ever seem to learn. Another man rode a speedboat out of Vera Cruz. He was feeling a little smug about getting a fairly easy trip home, there'd already been rumors about Marisol's trip north. All he had to do was not fall off the boat until they met the helicopter. Coatzacoalcos Mexico was tiny but it did boast an airport. Even a customs booth, a couple flights each day ended up in Miami. John Shepherd stood four spots from the front of the line. He looked around again. Nobody was paying much attention to him. At least no one he saw was paying attention. He might not notice. Or they could have tapped the cameras. *Just relax,* Shep thought. *This is a clean cover and I'm just being paranoid.* He hoped it was clean anyway. The ""travel desk"" didn't have a perfect record with cover identities. It didn't happen often, but he knew people it had happened to. Well, knew people that knew people it had happened to. Still, something seemed off. *Was that customs guy just staring at me? Why am I on edge?* He could stand here arguing with himself all the way to the counter and look too nervous when they asked him questions. Or he could roll the dice. Nope, fuck this. Shepherd began to swallow air, causing his stomach to make rumbling noises. He was a little proud of the one that made the woman in front of him turn around. ""Dude, are you okay?"" He winced and shook his head. ""Tequila and ceviche last night."" She grimaced. ""What were you thinking?"" ""Tequila was first. You think they'll care if I get out of line to find a john?"" ""Tell you what, we'll all probably care a lot more if you don't go now."" Her friend laughed. ""Go ahead, this place is chill. They see lotsa gringos."" There was an alarming noise from the area around his belt. Shep ran his hand over his face, wiping away imaginary sweat. ""Oh god,"" he blurted and lurched out of line. He covered his mouth and walked quickly. He burped a few times as he lurched away from the queue. Everyone else was looking away except for a couple of kids who looked delighted at his sick act. Shep barged into the large bathroom, walking normally once he was inside. He claimed the stall on the end and sat down. His stomach rumbled again and he grinned, patting it. He pulled out his passport and took a bottle of eyedrops from his carry-on bag. He carefully squirted a little over the pages inside. The pictures and printing seemed to peel up as soon as it touched the liquid and began to slough off the pages. He scooted back and let it run into the water below. He wiped the thing with a piece of toilet paper, cleaning the last of the ink away. The picture of his face was the same, but the suit and were gone, underneath the picture was another picture of him with slicked back hair and a deep tan. The suit was replaced by a coral necklace and tank top. He pulled the button up shirt off and dropped it in the toilet. The door opened and someone called the name of his cover. ""Yeah, I'm here,"" he gasped, tightening his abdomen. ""Senior, your plane is boarding. You must hurry."" ""Oh god, I can't…"" Shep grinned like a little kid as he farted. It was as loud and very unpleasant sounding. The bowl beneath him created a makeshift resonance chamber that bounced the sounds off the ceramic. ""Tell them to just go, okay? I'll get another flight, I can't move right now."" He could feel the pressure from the swallowed air moving lower and strained his abdomen. If anything, this explosion was worse. ""Madre Dios,"" he heard the man mutter. ""Do you need a doctor?"" ""Just call 911 when the screaming starts,"" Shep said, sounding exhausted. ""Talk to your airline, perhaps they can do something,"" the man said and the door closed. *And mom said doing that wouldn't get me anywhere in life. She'd be so proud.* He wore a colorful t-shirt under the button up shirt. A hat with a large red and white ""diver down"" patch was pulled out of his bag and unfolded. Some more of the whatever was in the bottle was added to his glasses turning the lenses black. The rest of the solution was poured in the toilet and the shirt immediately began to dissolve. *What the hell is this stuff?* He heard the plane taking off, the old turbojets shaking the building. Ten minutes later he flushed, wondering what that stuff would do to the plumbing. He stepped out and wet his hair, slicking it back with gel. Uptight software engineer Chris Hodges from LA was now the far more relaxed David Long from Austin, Texas. No one seemed to notice him any more or less now but he felt a lot better. Shep walked up to the new line forming at the customs desk. Once he was waved forward, the agent asked him how long he'd been in Mexico. Shep shrugged and looked embarrassed. ""Sorry dude, no hay Español,"" he lied. ""Estupido Americana,"" The customs agent laughed. ""Americana? You want to say Americano, Senor Long, an Americana is a woman."" Shep did his dumb surfer look for the guy. ""That's why everyone is laughing at me?"" ""Very possible. How long were you in Mexico?"" ""Five days, I was hanging out in Acapulco after helping my buddy take some buses to Belize."" The man nodded and typed something into a terminal. *Wouldn't be funny if *this* was the cover they screwed up?* Shep kept his breathing normal. He had a serious phobia about Mexican jail. The man read something on the screen and looked at Shep. ""Enjoy your trip home,"" the agent finally said and pushed the passport across the counter. ""Okay, thanks,"" Shep said, taking the passport and walking deeper into the airport. *Fucking Deirdre, making me watch Midnight Express last night.* The only people in the concourse were the ones standing around waiting for the flight. Shep sighed as he sat on a halfway comfortable seat and stretched his legs out. It had been brutal down here. Long hours deep in the forest and the bugs had been merciless. Not to mention the sleeping arrangements. And he'd been promised some beach time. He'd planned to spend a week half drunk with some of the local lovelies. Shep stretched slightly. *And fuck hammocks too. Maybe I can sleep on the plane.* He glanced around. There were three familiar faces scattered around but he ignored the three of them and they ignored him back. Three on one flight was pushing the limits of an discrete exfiltration. Admittedly, that was partly his fault but someone way up the food chain was in a big hurry to get something done, sand and pina coladas be damned. A baby in the row of seats behind him started crying, if you could call it that. Really, it just sounded pissed off. *Merciful universe, please no.* The crying woke up another one of the little monsters and it started squalling too. Shep sighed. ~~~~ This new hotel was a lot nicer than the last one, Kawehi decided as she finally turned off the shower. They'd gone up a few rungs on the accommodations to ensure that they wouldn't accidently run into their former co-workers. The sixty-five miles between the two places had probably been enough but Marisol was still irritated so she'd spent more money than she was supposed to. It was just the three of them until the rest of Marisol's strike team arrived. Jonesy was still with the migrant workers. He'd protested but he was the only one of them that knew what the target looked like and the team needed to keep eyes on him. When she saw the new room, Kawehi was tempted to send him a picture but decided not to rub it in too much. The rest of the team would be here soon and once they'd snatched the kid the worst of it would be over. All they had to do after that was take a relaxing road trip out west. ~~~~ The man they all called Brother Dark sat in a small room above the town diner. His town, Brother Dark had long ago decided. The windows were covered in aluminum foil to keep the sun out of the room. The church folk thought his name came from the black suit and hat he always wore. They were worse than fools though, unable to see anything beyond the obvious. He was dark in name and appearance but his name came from an even darker nature. The fools took him for a religious prophet which was useful. It allowed him a certain…latitude of behavior that would have been much more difficult otherwise. He looked up, annoyed when there was a tap at the door. ""What."" The door opened slightly and his current assistant looked in apologetically. ""I said no interruptions."" ""But there's some folk here to see you , Brother."" Dark cocked his head. ""Are you unaware of what the word 'interruption' means? Send them away and we will later review the importance of obedience."" The man swallowed but didn't close the door. Dark's continual curiosity overtook his anger. The man should be scuttling off in fear but something kept him there. ""Brother Dark, sir, I believe you'll want to meet these visitors."" Dark stood up and the man flinched. The curiosity was burning now, this insect would never disobey unless it were truly interesting. He ignored the fool as he stalked over to the door and threw it open. There were two men waiting for him. They had the same pale skin as Dark, the same black suits and hats. They stared at him. ""Leave,"" Dark said to the assistant and he scuttled out of the room, glad to be away from Brother Dark and whoever these new relatives of his were. Dark turned around and went back to his office without saying anything. The other two followed him inside. One of them closed the door firmly. ""I am Gnik,"" the slightly taller one said, speaking first to assert his authority. ""That is Szep. We are to Audit."" Dark sat down without offering either of them a seat. He broke the protocol to establish his own authority, to show them that he didn't care. He was the master here, not them. ""You say you are auditors but no reports are due and my experiment thrives."" ""So we have seen. It has grown, yes?"" Dark leaned back in the chair and steepled his fingers. ""By twenty-six point four nine percent. Nine points over the predicted median. These fools prattle on about their freedom and rights but they're so eager to surrender themselves to a perceived authority."" ""Yes, yes, you are most talented administrator. However our interest is not in growth. Just a single individual."" Dark's hand flashed toward his desk but as quick as he was, Gnik's stun dart hit his chest before he'd moved more than a few centimeters. A carefully modulated pulse of electricity flashed through his chest, neck, and head. Dark slumped slightly as his muscles loosened. He was completely paralyzed. ""My colleague misled you,"" Szep said, coming around the desk. ""While we are here to audit, we are not the Audit."" Gnik's mouth twisted in a parody of a smile. ""Forgive my clumsy speech, I am still learning these grunts. We are the Question."" Dark's stomach clenched. The Question, here! ""We are advancing to the next stage of our effort,"" Szep said, wrapping a wire around Dark's wrist. ""So all must be as it was ordered. Perhaps you remember the traitor Jenkins? She was silenced."" Dark strained to move but the shot had been perfect. It would take a while to get his muscles to move, probably far too late to do any good. ""Now we are come to your fascinating experiment,"" Gnik said, pulling a small box out of his coat. ""The Question was certain that you had complied with all the directives you had been given. My brother here was surprised I guessed you had not. The Curiosity is a filthy growth and I remember your arrogance. But you impress me, my wayward brother. Outright treason, my brother? Naked disobedience to the Sacred Protocols? Your outrages go beyond even my imagination."" Dark put all of his will into making his finger move. There was a slight twitch, hardly noticeable. He could get out of this and he had to do something quickly before… White light burst behind his eyes and Dark's body arched. After a few seconds they let him fall back into the chair. He tried to catch his breath but convulsions shook his body. The wires wrapped around him induced an answering current in his nerves. They could deliver any sensation directly into his brain. There was no defense. ""Just a test,"" Gnik said. ""Have you never been under an inducer? You might be surprised to know I have my own experiments as well. Of course, mine are sanctioned by my betters. Allow me to explain, I've created a nerve induction protocol of my very own. Have you seen a Question Bringer work? A talented Bringer can vivisect a subject while they are conscious of course. But it takes a master to completely remove the skin without killing the subject. Of course the subject is quite insane by the end of the process. My humble contribution removes any worry that a subject will die from shock, leaving them untouched although they feel their flesh peel away. The pain has driven several to madness, but you must remember the Fifth Protocol, 'The Future Comes in Tiny Steps.' Let him move a bit, Szep. I want him to answer me."" The iron bands wrapped around Dark eased a bit and he leaned his head back, gasping. ""Now, why did you let it live?"" Gnik asked. ""A little filthy curiosity of my own."" ""The directive was faulty,"" Dark said, swallowing against the nausea brought on by fear. ""I wanted to study it, see why it was so critical to remove and destroy. What if it is a weapon against us?"" Gnik clucked his tongue. ""Third Protocol, Brother. 'Obey without comment or question.' But since you've gone to all this trouble, I will have it brought here. I will take it apart piece by piece and it will be nothing special. You have paid a fool's price and all you've gained is a lesson on curiosity. On individuality. Before I disassemble your pet, I will remove your consciousness. You will never know the truth."" ""The Clamor, brother,"" Szep hissed. ""A fitting reward for a fool's willful curiosity!"" Dark gritted his teeth. ""You are fools who cannot see your hands in front of you."" Gnik regarded him dispassionately. ""Yet you are in my power. Szek, begin the special protocol."" At first there was nothing. Then a strange pulling sensation on his wrist began. Dark gasped as he felt his skin pulled away from the flesh, a narrow strip of agony crawling up his arm. It began on his other arm as well. He bit his lip bloody, refusing to give this animal the pleasure. There was another bright streak of agony across his forehead and Dark screamed as he felt a strip of scalp slowly pulled off. There were a few men nervously waiting outside of the door. The walls weren't very thick and they looked at each other when Dark shrieked. ""He screams higher than a woman,"" one whispered. There was another long scream, so high pitched it hurt their ears. One of the men stumbled out of the room, hand over his mouth as he retched."
"This is more of a general thing... when the NHL changed their jerseys to rounded at the bottom, a bunch of teams completely fucked up the design trying to keep a squared-off look. I'm going to pick on the Red Wings because it was the best picture I could find, but a ton of teams do this, either with stripes along the bottom or colors like the Wings. [Look how the Red Wings jersey is red down to the point an old jersey would've stopped, and then becomes white for absolutely no reason. You end up with this bizarre band of white jersey that makes it look like guys are skating around with their dress shirts untucked. I just don't get it.](http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/186ffcb477365f4695d003d7aceacf2b993a1db6/c=469-206-2249-1544&amp;r=x393&amp;c=520x390/local/-/media/2016/04/24/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/635970535971900736-redwings-041716-kpm-1007.jpg) Teams with stripes should have the stripes follow the curve at the bottom or have the bottom of the jersey be the same color as the pants, and teams with solid jerseys should just continue the color the whole way down. Edit: here's an example with stripes. [The Bruins' band of white below the stripes looks ridiculous on their white jerseys because of the black pants](http://cache4.asset-cache.net/gc/492713454-bret-connolly-of-the-boston-bruins-gettyimages.jpg?v=1&amp;c=IWSAsset&amp;k=2&amp;d=X7WJLa88Cweo9HktRLaNXly8Ayjt3CB2wfXunFZYTSFtoaazW8z3FqvVEA%2FtEfy5NqZkFpAPNu17lLFqTtXKPVhKAToYPz0SJh9Xjk%2FoXW4%3D). The same design works perfectly on their [home darks because the black band disappears into the black pants.](http://media.gettyimages.com/photos/patrice-bergeron-of-the-boston-bruins-celebrates-his-tying-goal-in-picture-id488019395)"

"Tried to format it a little better.  **Early-** Farming and position in lane, do u want to be agressive or passive, look at the matchup that generally tells u what u can expect from ur lane. Btw there is also a misconception that the support should lead the adc by going aggresive, HOWEVER u can as an adc lead ur adc by just moving up and attacking which will tell ur support ""Ohh damn his going ham better help him rek dis kid"". Also if ur REKING ur lane u should freeze and deny as much XP/Gold as possible. BUT this can be countered by lane ganks so get wards lad. Try not to get the tower until u want to force the game into mid game. **Mid Game-** Heres where many adc's make mistakes which can turn advantages to disadvantages. Mid game can be played in 2 ways, Teamfighting/ resuming lane. Teamfighting is self explanitory, you wanna force teamfights wherever u can and get objectives while ur at it. THIS can backfire as the enemy adc might solo farm bot while ur grouping at mid and the forcing a teamfight but the enemy stops u. This is bad as ur splitting 1 wave of xp/gold with 4 people while the adc has solo farm, this is typically what u see by streamers when they lose lane, its a good way to comeback, just FARM FARM FARM. Resuming lane is probably a little more risky, u continue laning with length advantage because generally midgame happens when u take their tower vice versa. Either way if u overextend u are more vulnerable to ganks by the jungler having more routes to get u. BUT if ur team is smart u can start warding that side of the map and gain map pressure and get jungle picks which can lead to objectives. **Late Game-** Simple, BE CONCENTRATED ON UR POSITIONING. I am not gonna go indepth to teamfighting as i CBBS its a pretty simple thing to understnd. This is THE most key thing i can stress as ur positioning as an adc can decide a game. Also what i find to help is having red buffs b4 the teamfights, it allows me to do true dmg which helps against tanks and the slow allows u to kite EASILY."
"Two wires go in, two wires come out. Seems neater to me. Otherwise you're probably gonna cram 2 wires into the 0v terminal?  Just a general tip. My theory is that the copper is free, so why not use it? I have never said ""damn, I wish there was a bit more resistance in my power rail"". Google for ""PCB trace resistance"" or similar and you'll find a bunch of tools if you want to calculate a number.  The data sheet should tell you how much power it dissipates. Like I said, I didn't really look at the circuit...  Yep, nothing wrong with that. You've got a few cases where the signal goes red/blue/red, which seems a bit pointless to me. I mean, sometimes you might want to do that to control the path taken by ground currents, but 5mm red / long blue / 5mm red isn't gonna be much different to just having the whole trace in blue."
"UHF is real channels 14-69, while VHF-Hi is real channels 7-13. You have ABC, CTV, and TVA in your VHF-Hi spectrum. Also, notice SRC and CBC how the PWR levels are red. That means that an amplifier is unneeded, and will likely cause signal loss or distortion if used with your aerial setup. So, you'd want to get an unamplified aerial such as the Winegard FlatWave FL-5000 (unamplified)"
"Up here in new england, intense red and cascade kriek both get distro and sit on shelves. While HT has weekly distro, it's still very very hard to get your hands on, so it's not going to trade for something that somebody can just walk into a store and buy on any given day unless it's of equal hype (re: pliny for example). With regards to CCB year rounds...Jai Alai won't get HT, but White Oak Jai Alai probably would."
"We are almost neighbors! There is still hope, if you are ok with a six hour drive you should check out Door County in Wisconsin, it's a really cool place to stay and camp (make reservations early because it's a very popular spot) and it's a good enough dark spot compared to what we have around us. You can stay at Peninsula State Park or Potawatomi State Park (both great camping spots) if you like comfort stay at Peninsula and when it gets dark (make sure it's a new moon or close) head over to the Eagle Bluff Lighthouse (you can just drive there) and there won't be a single soul there and it's really dark other than then light form the lighthouse. If you go there make sure to hike the Minnehaha Trail because it's really pretty. Also while you are there make sure to stop on your way back at Cave point for a few hour hike along the shore and you won't regret it. Here are some pictures I took this summer at Peninsula... https://i.imgur.com/lcbJvMK.jpg https://i.imgur.com/fP4K2Mj.jpg https://i.imgur.com/kDdBv7p.jpg https://i.imgur.com/3ZpnxCB.jpg  But since you are driving for six hours what you should do is head over to [Newport State Park](https://www.doorcounty.com/newsletter/november-2017/door-county-s-internationally-recognized-dark-sky/) it's a dark sky park, that means that after dark only red light are allowed. The only downside is that if you are going to stay I'm not sure they have drive in campsites. The other option is to go and camp in Rock Island, it will be really dark there because there is nothing there. Make reservations ahead of time because this one is really hard to get in on a weekend. And keep in mind that this is hike only, you'll leave your car in Northpoint, take a ferry to Washington Island, and then take a second ferry to Rock Island, then hike up to your campsite on the shore of Lake Michigan away from all the noise and light pollution."
"We are already having issues with people leaving unions in Denmark. In 1995 (at the height of union membership), 73% of Danes were in a union. In 2014, union membership had gone *up* to 69%. There is also a general trend away from traditional ""red"" unions (unions responsible for CBAs) are losing membership towards newer ""yellow"" unions (unions which has few, if any, CBAs). This is because yellow unions tend to be cheaper, since they don't have to pay for the people responsible for negotiating CBAs, nor do they have the ability to strike. As can be seen [here](https://i.gyazo.com/ff99886a6f2dc68c295c95c29b2360a3.png), the two red umbrella unions (LO and FTF) has been losing members, rapdily in the case of LO, while AC (union for academics) and Ledernes (union for executives of all kinds). The last blue one in the middle are the yellow unions, which have seen a slight increase. The actual numbers can be found [here](https://i.gyazo.com/763e3b70072c0e724c0446dee725fced.png). So people are *already* leaving unions, and I definitely fear that if you start legislating the job of the unions, such as minimum wage, people will start leaving unions even faster, continually decreasing the power of unions."
"We are the number 3 defense in terms of total yards given up, allowing only 312 yards a game, yet for whatever reason we just can't stop other teams from scoring. Despite the fact that all 5 defensive pro bowlers have a direct influence on the passing game, (pass rusher x2, corner x2, safety x1), we are still just the 12th ranked team in terms of passing yards allowed, and 26th in pass td's allowed. We used to use the excuse that our opponents have more possessions due to our high powered, fast paced offense and were throwing all the time to play catch up, but I am not so sure that is the case this year, especially in the past few games (though it is worth noting that we have the ball thrown on us in terms of attempts more than any team in the NFL) We give up on average 1.8 points per drive which is 15th in the NFL. The average number of plays per drive against us is 5.5 which is 7th in the NFL and the average time per drive against us is 2:27 which is 5th in the NFL, so it's not like our defense is spending a ton more time on the field than most teams, and getting tired. Looking at the statistics, we are a good to great defense in almost every single category but scoring. We are great against the run, we don't have a lot of long drives against us, we have a good pass rush, but we just can't keep other teams out of the end zone. That seems counter-intuitive because typically teams who can stop the run are good in the red zone and don't give up a lot of points. Typically teams with 2 pro bowlers at CB and 1 at safety are not ranked 26th in passing touchdowns allowed. What gives, is it Del Rio's fault? Who should get the blame for our terrible scoring defense? (Link to the stats for anyone interested) http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/den/2014.htm"
"We reached the markets, still arm in arm. Unlike our first date in the AMR, nobody stared at him with two women- it wasn’t immediately clear that this was, well, a date. Just three people out on the town. There was a certain frenetic nature to the marketplace as closing time approached. Street vendors shouted, trying to make one last sale, shoppers walking briskly about, trying to find an end of day deal, it was exactly as I’d remembered. I was enamored. ""Wow, the market got bigger."" Jessie noted. Wilcox thought for a moment. ""Let's go get the stuff you need first, Jessie, then we can stop by and take a look at the comics. And maybe just wander around a bit if we want to in the middle. Sound like a plan?"" ""Sounds good to me, I need a new shoot bang."" I fell in line behind them. ""What, am I not good enough for you?"" I teased Jessie. The shopping trip was pleasant but uneventful. At the end of it, Jessie was proudly holding a brand new CBJ-MS. We came back to the comic book store. The market was both an inside-and-out type, with a descending gate allowing for the owner to shutter the business after pulling in some of the outdoor racks. Harsh lights illuminated the shop, and there were a couple cramped chairs. The owner himself was modestly overweight and pasty pale with thick spectacles, though he was otherwise tall and wearing clothing that fit him and were in decent condition, a rare luxury in FR. The sign overhead proclaimed in large bold letters, ""NEWEST ISSUES OF WASTELAND COMICS!"" I eyed the comic stand more closely. It seemed to be one of the biggest yet least popular of the ones along the drag. There was quite a lot in stock, but very few customers at this hour. Perfect. There were gigantic wall posters of me, Bailey, Jameson, Burn, Psycho, Princess, The Borsons, Ash, Wilcox, Jessie, Salem, Bolts, Iron Hands, Death Empress, and Trockle, and probably more. All of us adorned the walls, and even the ceiling in a makeshift wallpaper. There were some people I wasn’t the most familiar with or simply couldn’t place, as well, but most were people both Washington and I knew. There were even books were on racks; thick-looking paperbacks. I’d heard that the reporter, Frank, had put one out in hardcover, and I saw a few copies on a rack. Magazines- including something from Archer, was kept in a separate section that was marked 18+, along with some older rags that had been scrounged from someone's basement or closet. A series of swords of various makes were on the wall behind the shop owner. Many were Katanas, but I also spotted in equal number replicas of Princess's own now-famous sword, Rapier- though it lacked the finish and polish of the genuine article. I even spotted the bastard sword that Trockle had given me. As I looked around- I saw my own comic likeness giving a thumb's up on some diet pills and other products. A love potion had Jessie's face on it. Fireworks with Jack's stupid grin, and a (likely bootleg) 'Wacky Williams Approved!"" sticker on a product he probably wouldn't have approved of- it looked too incapable of removing appendages for him to ever give it a real thumb's up. Wall to wall unapproved merchandize. Ash was on the cover of the latest magazine, which was proudly on display in the center rack. Her suit didn't resemble the one she had actually piloted; it was clearly one of the FR models with a custom paint job. Clutched in its giant hand was a decapitated robot head, stripped of flesh and staring with wires coming out of the back of it. Presumably, Ve. I towed Jessie inside, looking for the comics which lined the walls. Oh god, so many. So very, very many. ""They sure like to embellish things."" Jessie sighed, thinking back to what really happened the day the war kicked off. ""Washington wasn't there. But he's apparently pieced it together well enough,"" I replied after palming one and flipping through it quickly. ""It hits the right notes. I guess he had to wrangle with censors, or was encouraged to write things a certain way."" I flipped the page to the last one- there was an old photo of Washington in BDUs, with a platoon of men all smiling for the camera- Washington was circled in red to show which one he was. It did not say much else about him, though, for 'about the author,' just his jobs and where he had been since the FCC. Strange. ""Yeah."" Jessie nodded in agreement. I continued browsing, dragging Jessie along. ""There's a...Jameson Cologne, a Pearl Perfume, a Jessie Vitamin Regiment..."" I continued. There was no proper FDA anymore- lord only knows what’s in these containers. The sticker price on the items were quite high, explaining the lockboxes everything except the display items were secured inside of. Making custom glass objects and items is not cheap in the apocalypse. The everyday comic shop had gone from the seedy dive to a high-class establishment. The man behind the counter, however, was too engrossed in his comic to look up. That was in line with what I’d heard of comic book shops. Some things never change, I guess. ""Excuse me,"" I tried. ""Which of these might feature, uh... Pearl?"" It was strange to refer to oneself in the third person, but I managed to pass off my hesitance as uncertainty about my own name, as though I were a new reader. Annoyed at being pulled out of his immersion, he blew a lock of hair from his eyes. ""...whatever, every real fan knows to check 'Moonlight Murder,' or perhaps 'Tales from the FCC Smith.' She's one of our bestsellers; they had to reprint them. But if you want an original?” He rolled his eyes, not bothering to fix me with a look. “You can't afford it."" He jerked a thumb to behind him without looking out of his magazine. It was on display for 30 AMR Credits. Jessie stifled a giggle. ""What about ‘Jessie’?"" I asked. ""Jessie? Yeah. Deadly Duo, Part One covers Jessie, Part two covers Pearl also, actually. Good catch,"" he mused, still not looking up. ""Honestly, most of them involve a vignette of one of the pair in some sense. Princess was a real seller, though. She makes a great villain, and she's getting volume again now with the bounty on her head. People think they can glean some insight from her if they snag the rags. I even had a few people buying her sword here, and one of every volume that had anything to do with her."" He shrugged. ""He swore she was seen headed up to Massachusetts just a week ago, and he wanted to get in on the action, and to ‘think like she does’."" There was the unmistakable click of a camera, but by the time I looked for it, there was nothing there. Weird. I shook my head. That was a stupid amount of money on Princess’s head, and it made people do all sorts of stupid things- the bounty was almost equal to the economic output of the combined whole FCC for half a year. Perhaps assigning a scout to bring her in...? I nodded. ""Any news of Professor Bailey? Jack the Scotsman?"" ""Demolition Dirty,"" he said. ""Battle of Pleasantville has some stuff with Jack in it, as well."" Jessie looked pleased. “Thanks,” I said. I continued back and started finding ones with covers and artwork. I found a beautiful poster. Jessie stood in the daytime, blue skies and puffy clouds, surrounded by sunflowers. My comic-self held a hand out to Jessie, standing in the shadows with stars and no clouds, glowing pale skin radiant in the moonlight. Real-Jessie snagged a copy quickly. I planted a quick kiss on her cheek. ""Oh,"" the clerk's voice echoed from over the racks. ""I forgot, but there's the Iron Hands collections. Those are adults only, obviously, it keeps concerned parents out of our shop. Bolts gets his start there, if you are after the whole FCC Set, since that’s what you were asking about. I think Mercy's getting her own issues soon, but the Founding Author had to do more research. It'll be next to the Jameson novels, most of which are *also* eighteen and up."" ""No shit."" Jessie chuckled. I giggled. ""How much for a poster? Or enough to set up a room like this? How much is each comic?"" ""It varies, prices are printed on the backs of most. AMR credits take a slight penalty economically because of exchange rates and a 9% tax, but in bulk we might be able to swing you a deal."" ""Oh, just a few, I think,"" I said slowly. I began gathering magazines. I already had a handful. These were actually fun, in a weird way, and it was a bit exhilirating. I had not been this excited to read in weeks! Jessie picked out a few comics of her own, mostly of the ones about her. ""I think I know someone who might like this,"" I plucked ‘A Deadly Game’ from a shelf. ""Maybe get some for Mom?"" I asked. This stack was getting large. ""I'll get some for her. I'll get some for Jack too!"" Jessie exclaimed. Wilcox browsed around, hoping not to see his likeness anywhere. He found it, a large display under ""Hero of Manhattan."" Wilcox picked up one of his graphic novels and flipped to a page showing his captivity under Death Empress. ""Foul wench?!"" He exclaimed. ""I never called her a wench! I called her a bitch!"" ""Yeah buddy, whatever you call your girlfriend,"" the clerk replied said, paging through idly and still not caring. I shushed Wilcox. ""Settle down, there's worse inaccuracies."" I pointed at Ash's FR robot. Wilcox pointed - ""It says I tamed a Tank!"" he said quietly. ""...and that's a problem? That's pretty kickass."" I replied. ""Even though I don't like tanks."" ""But it isn't true!"" Wilcox hissed. ""Neither is this,"" I held out an issue of myself on a promotional flyer speaking to a servant. It read: ""*Bring me my blush, tonight I'm dressed to kill*."" ""Oh. Wait, I see- these are fictional accounts."" I pointed at the category sign at the top of the shelf- it had a symbol matched on the cover with a seal. Wilcox chuckled at the dressed to kill line. ""You should totally say that, Pearl. It's a pretty good line."" I looked down at my fine attire and sniffed. ""I don't dress to kill. I mean, I do have custom suits... but... I'm not that clothing obsessed, am I?"" Jessie said nothing, looking away wistfully. ""You kind of are, actually. It's cute, though."" Wilcox replied. We all sat in the corner and began to read... [edit: continued in part 2]"

"Well, as an Employee Representative for a local government union I can give you some insight, based on my experience as well as what was noted in the article. A union's job (besides negotiating the contract) is just to make sure that violations are not happening from the CBA. So when discipline or firing happens the union will be involved only to the extent that they make sure there were no violations of the contract in the discipline or firing. This makes me immediately assume that there weren't any violations. And you can see this in the article as well. It was clearly stated in a document which the teacher signed and reasonably was expected to know about as such which stated, in bold, caps, and red lettering ""NO ZEROES - 50% MINIMUM GRADES"". If a person came to me asking for representation over *this* then I would tell them flat-out that they were likely fired for just cause as defined in the CBA. The teacher knew about it (the teacher had been employed there for a VERY long time, the document was required to be known by the staff, it was signed by the teacher, and it was very explicitly called out in the document) and as such decided to go with her own personal agenda rather than uphold the known and *highly important* policies of her employer. This would likely (and reasonably) be considered gross insubordination. Hence the just cause. Hope this helped you!"
"Well, broadcast stations, just a normal AM or FM radio, particularly at night in the summer with AM, you can hear stations due to atmospheric propagation that you wouldn't normally from time to time. e.g. Chicago stations or Canadian stations coming in to NJ. The way you figure it out is to be bored enough to wait until the station identifies and look up the call letters if they don't say where they are directly. With shortwave, the fun in it was direct news from the perspective of foreign nations, Deutsche Welle for West Germany (at the time), Monitor Radio (Christian Science Monitor, actually was a pretty good news source), BBC etc etc you would get the national perspective on global events. Back then it wasn't the same carefully groomed story line being parroted by everyone. Now AP, Reuters, BBC, CNN, they are all just trumpeting the same noise. In the end of the Cold War days, Radio Havana and many other stations, you would get the ""red"" point of view to world events, was fascinating to compare the spin. My first transmitting radios were CB band walkie talkies that were eventually radios in my car. With CB you can ""shoot skip"" which is where I learned about atmospheric propagation. Randomly you would hear stations from the mid-west from the East Coast. The fun is trying to reach them and see if they can hear you. I talked to people all over the U.S., Canada, the Caribbean, Central and South America sitting in my car on a CB. These days there are very inexpensive SDR receivers that are super fun to play with as you get the whole visual element of the spectrum when you use them. One of my favorites is the basic SDRPlay RSP radio because it covers such a wide amount of spectrum. It's just a receiver but for the money it's incredibly entertaining to play with. If you take the time to make a proper antenna for them (as long as you can fit, you can put up a 260' long dipole made of wire if you want or just 40' or so) they are really amazing. You can hear a lot in the higher frequencies with just a good scanner antenna or a telescopic whip 3' or so long."
"Well, it's not that simple. They wanted something that speed-wise is in between a normal train and high-speed train. The high-speed line also already has the Thalys operating on it, which is basically a TGV train painted in red (SNCF, DB and NMBS/SNCB partnership). At first they wanted a train with a top speed of 220km/h, at that point Alstom and AnsaldoBreda were the 2 remaining bidders. Alstom with a traditional locomotive + carriages, Ansaldo with their V250. Then the speed requirement was raised to 250km/h (no idea why), Alstom withdrew because they had nothing to offer at that speed point (and buying a TGV set for that is a bit expensive) so they basically had no choice but to go with AnsaldoBreda (the fact that they were the cheapest was a plus in the eyes of the railway companies though the we've obviously seen why now). There's also European rules for buying new trainsets. They can't just march up to Alstom, Bombardier or Siemens and say ""we need 19 trains"". All manufacturers should be allowed to compete and the cheapest must be chosen that meets the requirements set forth by the railway companies. In this case, a proven design was not one of those requirements. They can choose to ignore it, but then fines have to be paid. So as you can see, it's a complex matter to say the least, and I spent way too much time following this and reading up on it :p Also, just as a side note, buying from a reputable constructor like Siemens still isn't a guarantee of quality, the NMBS has bought several (200-ish I think) Desiro trainsets and they break down every 8000km. this in stark contrast with the HLE18 (also built by Siemens, based on the Taurus IV) which has a break down every 36000km. Then again, part of that is due to the specific requirements the NMBS had for the Desiro trainsets."
"Well, it's partly the color scheme that was chosen, but it's also the particular resolution of data that was used, combined with how most US cities are currently organized. History of the automobile, redlining and segregation, white flight, etc. You might expect cities to look like a little mountain, but instead, they are like volcano craters, with a high ring around the outside and a little lower in the middle. I'm glad zip codes were chosen instead of counties for example, because you can see much more detail. Most US cities are poorer inside the city surrounded by wealthy suburbs. There may be a spike in the central business district - in this map, you can clearly see the red of Manhattan surrounded by the yellow-oranges of the Outer Boroughs and the Newark Basin, then more red farther out. DC has the same phenomenon, but it's a little harder to make out. A lot of cities have a green spot in the very middle instead of a red spot. If you extrapolated this into 3D it would be even more interesting to look at. You can see which cities have high-performing or struggling downtowns. I don't know if this only looks at residential income, or business income too, but in any case a city with a struggling CBD will not have a ton of high-income residents right downtown either. Cities with red cores: * New York * Boston * DC * Philly * Atlanta * Houston * Miami (i think) * Chicago (i think) * Seattle * Portland * SF * Las Vegas * Denver? Cities with green cores: * Detroit * Milwaukee * Cleveland * Indianapolis * Dallas? Several more of the big midwestern cities but I can't tell because I don't have enough landmarks to orient myself by. State lines would be helpful"
"What ammo are you using? Go with the M61 APCBC, it has fantastic performance for its tier, well worth the cost. Don't carry too much ammo either, that can save you a lot of unnecessary deaths. Most important Sherman tip: Don't expose your sides. Your side armour isn't that thick, and is a pretty large target. If an enemy can hit the front third of it at a reasonable angle, they'll likely kill all your crew. Your front armour meanwhile is decently thick *and* well sloped. So be a brave soldier and always face the enemy head on. Specific targets: Shoot T-34s in the turret, that should go through most of the time. StuGs, shoot [the red area](https://i.imgur.com/e5FizPk.png) to do [this](https://i.imgur.com/IbYF0jP.png). If that doesn't take them out in one shot, put another one in the orange area. It's not a large target, but *very* effective, and the StuG is forced to show it in order to shoot you."

Malkin is in a similar boat, but he has an extra game remaining. MacKinnon only has 2 points in his last 5, but he has 4 games left so anything can happen. Giroux and Kopitar are red hot with 8 points in their last 5, but it seems unlikely that Kopitar hits 100 as he's sitting at 90 points with only 3 games left. Let's take a look at how each player has done against their remaining opponents so far this season. **Nikita Kucherov [](/r/tampabaylightning):** - vs NSH [](/r/predators) 1G, 2PTS in 1GP - vs BOS [](/r/bostonbruins) 0G, 2PTS in 3GP - vs BUF [](/r/sabres) 0G, 2PTS in 2GP - vs CAR [](/r/canes) 1G, 2PTS in 2GP **Evgeni Malkin [](/r/penguins):** - vs WSH [](/r/caps) 2G, 5PTS in 3GP - vs CBJ [](/r/bluejackets) 2G, 5PTS in 3GP - vs OTT [](/r/ottawasenators) 1G, 2PTS in 2GP **Claude Giroux [](/r/flyers):** - vs NYI [](/r/newyorkislanders) 1G, 5PTS in 3GP - vs CAR [](/r/canes) 0G, 1PTS in 3GP - vs NYR [](/r/rangers) 1G, 6PTS in 3GP **Nathan MacKinnon [](/r/coloradoavalanche):** - vs ANA [](/r/anaheimducks) 1G, 1PTS in 2GP - vs LAK [](/r/losangeleskings) 0G, 2PTS in 2GP - vs SJS [](/r/sanjosesharks) 2G, 3PTS in 1GP - vs STL [](/r/stlouisblues) 2G, 3PTS in 3GP **Anze Kopitar [](/r/losangeleskings):** - vs COL [](/r/coloradoavalanche) 4G, 5PTS in 2GP - vs MIN [](/r/wildhockey) 1G, 4PTS in 2GP - vs DAL [](/r/dallasstars) 0G, 2PTS in 2GP"

"Yeah, it's a pretty simple drive. I think it's like 7 miles. During my drive to work and home in the evening, I probably average 25-30 mph. Maybe hit 4 or 5 stop lights. Nothing too crazy. When I go home for lunch, I hit probably the same number of stop lights, but have much fewer people on the roads. Probably average 40-50 mph during lunch. This would be most of my driving, so something I could have fun with at red lights and getting up to 40-50mph pretty quickly is huge for me. Prior to my comment on this post, I didn't really realize that a 600 super sport isn't really what I want in order to do that. Now it's just a matter of deciding between the Ninja 650 and the CBR650F. In terms of looks, I think I'd lean towards the Ninja. However, just about everything else seems to favor the CBR. The additional power, the more aggressive riding position, the Honda name/reputation, etc. Seems like used Ninjas are a much easier find, or at least they are in my area so that might skew the decision when it comes time."

On a side note, what are your thoughts on Coloring Book Sakuya vs. Revo Sakuya?

"Yes. However, the real red flag is whether you have a method in mind or a date. It's also a bad sign if you use the prospect of suicide as a sort of exit plan, as something you keep in your back pocket should things ever get too tough for you. That said, fantasizing about your death isn't *good* and it may be time to start thinking about how you cognitively deal with stressful situations. You might consider, if you have the means and availability, to consider CBT and develop more healthy ways of dealing with life."
"You are right that this won't be popular here, and I can't agree myself. ~~I'll start off with what I like, and then go into some of the reasons I'm personally not a fan of this change.~~ Its a little long, but I've basically just typed as things came to mind so please bear with me :P. Also also, it is 4:45 am here (my sleep schedule is reeeekkkktttt) so please forgive me if I'm a little incoherent, if I have time I'll try to edit this tomorrow. I assume by directional thrust you still mean a similar to her current jump jet ability, but maybe at an angle closer to 45 degrees. If so, I'm honestly not as opposed to this as I thought I would be from your title. Ngl, it does sound pretty fun being able to fly towards and over the other team in one quick movement, and it does lead towards some interesting and fun new strategies (leaping behind tanks with a hail of rockets, anyone?) That leads me to my next point. Despite what I said in my previous paragraph, adding this new ability wouldn't give Pharah any more mobility. She already has high mobility thanks to her concussive blast (CB) and jump jets. She can already leap behind tanks with her CB and can leap above/behind enemies with her Jump Jets. Removing her hover jets in favour of this new ability wouldn't add anything new to her kit. As a result, it would be impossible to brand this as anything but a massive nerf, which I'm not sure she needs right now (I'll touch more on this later). You mentioned that these changes might encourage the use of CB as a disruption tool, but again I'm not sure I would agree. Part of what makes her CB so effective is that you have a great vantage point to shoot from, and are somewhat removed from the battle. Imagine, for instance, how clumsy it would feel if Soldier 76's helix rocket blast radius were quadrupled (S76's rockets currently have a 2m radius and Pharah's CB has 8m radius). A very effective way she can currently use her CB is by firing it behind, beside someone to knock them out of position. But with the inability to hover in the air for any meaningful amount of time, it would be difficult to shoot rockets over the red team's heads and behind them, as that vantage would be gone. Also, if she were to be firing it from ground level, it might start to be used as a closer range weapon. This could add some interesting disengage potential (potential that is currently in the game anyway, though). However more often then not I could see the self-knockback getting in the way with these changes as it would be a lot easier for Pharah herself to be caught in the knockback (which ironically is part of what this change was trying to avoid). From a character design perspective I'm not sure this would work either. To be fair, if she did retain the rocket leap ability in some form, she wouldn't be completely grounded. But even then, a core part of her identity as a character is her ability to fly. Even when Blizzard has reworked characters in the past, they have always tried to keep core abilities. Removing Pharah's hover jet ability from her kit would be as drastic as removing torb's turret from his. It is simply who they are as a character. Finally, as I said earlier, this would be a blatant nerf to Pharah. Now, I will add a disclaimer here, I have not played Overwatch in about a month now (due to life being busy and not having the time atm), so I'm not sure how she feels in the current meta and will go off what she was like when I last played. I honestly don't think Pharah needs a nerf right now at all. She is in an interesting place where she is too strong in low tiers and too weak in high tiers. To your credit, this change might actually solve this issue. If she couldn't fly, she wouldn't be as dominant in lower tiers and wouldn't be sniped out of the sky in high tiers. However, if an ability is making a character weaker, the solution isn't to remove the ability completely, but to buff it. There is [a great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsC8io4w1sY) that talks about how buffs should be preferred to nerfs. I think instead of taking away her ability to fly altogether, we should increase her mobility in the air to increase her survivability in higher tiers. A great idea I've seen thrown around is letting 'crouch' let you quickly dive. This would be more difficult to master, which would increase the skill ceiling and would affect high tiers more than low tiers. I also think that if paired with the 'crouch' change, Blizzard made a good choice with her rockets, as this too would provide the desired effect of reigning in her reign in the lower tiers (although as an aside I will admit I'm not happy with these changes on their own... they feel like too much of a straight nerf). So yeah anyway, to be frank, I don't think this is quite as a terrible idea as my knee jerk reaction thought it was, but I'm still not sure I agree with it."

On a similarly cold evening there was a newly released prisoner, [picture a man of average height with a white jacket, red button up, and slicked back brown hair.](http://imgur.com/a/vrGST) This man's goal is to become a rakugo performer, and to do that he went straight to the top and asked [Yuurakutei Yakumo](http://imgur.com/a/TuzvO). ""Please, oh please master. I'll do anything to be your apprentice. I have no where else to go,"" he pleaded. Though the master he asked said he doesn't take on apprentices, he instead told the young man the story of his life, and a story about Rakugo itself. The way that this man told the story was masterful. He made all of the characters and their interactions feel as real as they could be. Of the most detailed characters were the man himself when he was younger, [a quiet, reserved, and slightly uptight boy.](http://imgur.com/a/ZRCB6) The other was the father of his ward, and oh was that boy strange. [He was dirty, boorish, lazy, constantly in debt](http://imgur.com/a/PiFeO), the problems just rolled in. And yet, while these two were wildly different in so many ways, they became friends quite quickly and established a rivalry alongside their friendship. ""I'll be better at Rakugo than you, and take the master's name,"" said the boorish one. The quiet one only scoffed at him, as he always did. Over time these boys grew together in both age and personality. In that time these boys met many interesting people that would shape their personalities until the end, [such as their Rakugo intsructor](http://imgur.com/a/rSXvK), [or the one who would be involved in their romances](http://imgur.com/a/IUlFw), and many different places. The places themselves were described in [exquisite detail](http://imgur.com/a/nHZhI) and ranged between so many locations that it's hard to choose as to which was the best. Festivals, stages, bathhouses, bars, theatres, inns, the countryside, the whole nine yards. The way this man described these places was so fantastic that it was almost as though you could see them yourself. Somehow in all of this, the master storyteller managed to not only describe these characters and locations in detail, but even the music that these people heard. One specific set that the man truly focused on were the [jazz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K28Lcc-MdJs) [pieces](https://my.mixtape.moe/fkbfop.mp4) that these characters heard in bars and in the cities. If you could hear them you'd never want to stop listening, as they were some of the best jazz you would've heard in your life. And so the master closed his story, with an ending that shocked the man even though he already knew it. The man vowed to become as good of a rakugo performer as the master.

"[NCBI is a great tool for scientists to share their data or to get documentation on any given topic related to their field or not.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) I guess it's not super well known for non scientific people but I think it's a great tool for any person interested science for any given topic. It's from where most scientific articles on reddit come from, researchers sometimes post their full articles on it for free. I don't hold any grudge against redditors who get excited on /r/science or anything where people post scientific articles over article titles like ""Cancer cured in mouse"" or ""Complete neural regeneration obtain on chicken embryo"" (I'm inventing btw), the title sounds rad, and the scientific articles are generally not easy to read. Not everyone on reddit (myself included) is a native english speaker, and even tho scientific articles are made to be as simple as possible, it can be very hard, even for someone into the scientific field, to follow throught an article without thinking ""wait, what did they do ?"". But try to read the abstract and the introduction if you can, in it you get what their researched, why, and what they obtained without much details. And investigating a research paper can be pretty tricky, I think the best way to do it is to not believe 100&amp;#37; of the stuff written on an articles, it's not rare for scientists to over interpret their finding in order to give more legitimaty on their paper, it's not a bad thing because usually it allow them to get more view and more fundings. I remember last year (I'll be in september a graduate neuroscience student btw) when I red an article about duchenne myopathy from 2004 where they simulated the disease in mice and tried to stimulate a pathway with a protein in order to maybe delay the symptom or something, the paper had a few problem like their worked only in muscles and not on the whole animal and the statistics of their results showed that there wasn't any major statistical difference with or without the added protein pathway, they still were like ""look ! it worked !! we can work more on this !!! let us work on this !!"". People should always keep a critic eye about scientific articles, just because something worked a few times on cells or on mice, it doesn't mean that it will works on human. On my former teacher worked on spinal chord regeneration, her team and others around the world found a great deal of stuff that worked in mice but almost never on apes and never on human. We don't really know why because it should, but it doesn't. That's why I didn't join the ""crispr cas 9"" excitement on reddit, it's a great tool for scientist and I'm realy looking forwards to see what will happen, but it's not something that works super well on animal models yet and it's definitely not the answer to any genetic problem for now."
"[Team USA](https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/11/politics/us-aegis-missile-defense-test-successful/index.html) is already doing that. But this is bleeding-edge technology.

First you have to see it coming. ~5min Then you have to recognize that it's a threat, and figure out it's flight path. ~5min. Then you order the guy with the anti-missile weapon to lock on and destroy the ICBM ~5min. That interceptor missile has WAY less than 5 minutes to get up to speed and destroy the ICBM before it goes nuclear. By then it's probably still over the suburbs of whatever major city it was targeting, so you're going to lose a few homes as the ICBM wreckage comes down.

"[X-post](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/2ccbz4/signs_a_new_restaurant_in_toronto_is_staffed_with/) from /r/videos. #I've never transcribed audio before, I hope this is alright. [\[00:00\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPgh5Yk2HaY&amp;t=0s) A unique dining experience has just reached Canada, you can find it in downtown Toronto. It's different because the menu not only caters to the taste buds, it also speaks a language of food you won't hear anywhere else. Ioanna Roumeliotis explains. [\[00:17 location change,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPgh5Yk2HaY&amp;t=17s) [00:20 Ioanna starts talking\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPgh5Yk2HaY&amp;t=20) The menus are ready, the sliders ready to grill, the staff dressed and ready to go. Opening night of a brand new restaurant in town where the goal of the evening is to have your order fall on deaf ears. [^\[cheering ^from ^staff\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPgh5Yk2HaY&amp;t=33s) Yep, you heard that right. [\[00:37, Anjan Manikumar - owner - starts talking\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPgh5Yk2HaY&amp;t=37s) This is Canada's first restaurant staffed with deaf waiters and waitresses, um... [\[00:41, Ioanna interjects over the 'um'\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPgh5Yk2HaY&amp;t=41s) But in terms of an idea, how ... [\[00:42, Anjan continues\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPgh5Yk2HaY&amp;t=42s) An idea, this is one, the first, first one of it's kind. [\[00:45, Ioanna resumes narrative\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPgh5Yk2HaY&amp;t=45s) Aptly named ""Signs"", this is a place where you have to follow the signs. Customers are asked to order food and drink using American Sign Language. There are icons next to every menu item, and a cheat sheet to help. [\[00:59, Lis Pimentel, customer\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPgh5Yk2HaY&amp;t=59s) Ohyeah, red.. something and then.. beet.. and then yeah, haha, watermelon [laughs]. [\[01:05, off-camera woman's voice, presumably Ioanna's\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPgh5Yk2HaY&amp;t=65s) And what does that mean? [\[01:07 Lis continues\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPgh5Yk2HaY&amp;t=67s) Red beet watermelon salad :) [\[01:09, man, no name given\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPgh5Yk2HaY&amp;t=69s) I'm gonna have the *duck*. [\[01:11, wife and Ioanna speak at same time\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPgh5Yk2HaY&amp;t=71s) Ioanna: What's that? Wife: Sign it! | Man: *Duck...* | Off camera female voice from opposite him: You have to sign it. | [Wife laughs]. [\[01:14, man again, whilst signing\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPgh5Yk2HaY&amp;t=74s) It's like *this* and like *this*. [\[01:16 one of the ladies opposite him is shown\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPgh5Yk2HaY&amp;t=76s) Exciting! [\[01:18 Ioanna resumes narrative\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPgh5Yk2HaY&amp;t=78s) Anjan Manikumar wanted to deliver a whole new dining experience and give deaf people a chance to shine. [\[01:25 Anjan continues\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPgh5Yk2HaY&amp;t=85s) Providing them an opportunity here I think is, it is something that they deserve, and they are very talented. Uh, Every one of them, every one of my staff, I am very happy to their they are extremely talented. [\[01:35 Ioanna\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPgh5Yk2HaY&amp;t=95s) More than 200 deaf people applied to work here. Most of the 50 or so who made the cut have no restaurant experience, but a passion to learn. [\[01:44 Rachel Shemuel, Manager\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPgh5Yk2HaY&amp;t=104s) Giving the Deaf community opportunity to work in a work in a work force that the wouldn't otherwise be able to work in, um, and it's opening up a whole new workforce for the Deaf community. [\[01:55 Ioanna\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPgh5Yk2HaY&amp;t=115s) This is Mehdi Safavi's first full-time job. An interpreter helped us ask him how that feels. [\[02:01 Mehdi Safavi, via voice of interpreter\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPgh5Yk2HaY&amp;t=121s) It's wonderful, I'm so excited to be here, it's a deaf environment where hearing people can come in and experience our world and our culture, so it's really amazing, really amazing. And it's a challenge for me but a great challenge. [\[02:16 Ioanna voiceover\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPgh5Yk2HaY&amp;t=136s) It's brand new but already there's a buzz, and reserveations are pouring in. [\[02:21 Ioanna interviewing Anjan\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPgh5Yk2HaY&amp;t=141s) Your biggest problem right now is that you have too much business? [\[02:23 Anjan\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPgh5Yk2HaY&amp;t=143s) I might, I might have too much busi-[laughs] yeah. [\[02:27 Ioanna voiceover\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPgh5Yk2HaY&amp;t=147s) And all through an entirely different word-of-mouth. Ioanna Roumeliotis, CBC News, Toronto.

"[[Datalog entry 7: Humans]] [Data is incomplete] [Language database is incomplete] [Partial transcription translated into modern English] [Author of databank is The Scribe (name given – native name is unknown, if it exists. Entity is known for recording thoughts for later review in stone, possibly a unique function of this being alone)] [Security clearance Alpha and higher required to view this document. Unauthorized access prohibited, on pain of death, heavy fine, or both] Humans.  When we first arrived on this planet, we thought it to be uninhabited. Not to say that it was devoid of life, of course. This rock, this third outcropping from the sun…it was very much alive, even before we arrived. Oceans, foliage, and the like teemed with life, burned with the souls of billions. But, as always, we were alone in the universe. There was no sentient life here, no Minds like our own. Or so we thought.  Humans. We saw them everywhere, covering the planet’s rocky surface from sea to sea. How could we not? Their structures burned with light, with life. They themselves teemed with energy, zipping back and forth across the stone. For some, they were great amusement: [The Warrior] seemed to find them great fun to chase, to flatten into iron-rich smears beneath his feet. [The Thinker] was more cautious, wanting to understand what they were before he acted. After all, despite not being the dominant species on the planet – that honor went to the plurality of vegetation, at least by mass – they *were* quite prolific and industries. Perhaps, as [The Thinker] suggested, they were even self-aware. We laughed at him for that.  To the others, such as myself and [The Builder], Humans were simply a curiosity. They were quick, to be sure, and they built fantastic structures out of metal and stone and lifematter, but nothing more. Personally, I saw them as little more than sophisticated insects, building hives of steel. Certainly, I had seen many such things on [The Journey]. A hundred thousand worlds seeded, over an impossible span of time…how was I to know this one was different? How was I to know that these…humans…were anything more than bugs, insignificant enough to squash beneath our feet? They were so small, with only a single pair of arms and legs on which to stand! Certainly, they could not [Leap] as we could, nor could they survive the harshness of space if they were to escape their miserable rock. They were not like [Us], like [The People]. Quick? Maybe. Clever? Certainly. But they could never know true [Thought]. They could never know [The Self].  I was wrong.  I was wrong, and it seems that all of my brethren were wrong as well. [The Warrior] was the first to go – certainly, he spent too long among their silvered hives, painting them red and brown with the dead. He was meant to be the strongest of us all, the defender that kept us alive when we met something that was truly a threat. Maybe he was right, and a part of him knew that these humans were dangerous, but all it got him was an early grave. Eons too young, smoldering in a crater of radioactive debris! It was a sad way for one as proud as he to go. And still, I do not know how they could have done it.  [The Builder] was next. He built, as he was meant to do, but he took no heed as to the locations of the hives. They took him the same day, leaving both himself and his structures in ruins. They took no heed of their own hives, though [The Builder] himself had noticed a lack of Humans on the surface on that day. Perhaps they went underground, knowing that Death approached on quiet wings. It was them, [The Thinker] had said. They had known.  Now, I am alone. I do not know where [The Thinker] has gone, except to hide away. I can feel it in my mind that he is still alive, wherever it is that he has vanished off to. I wish that he had taken me. Five dead! Five! Untold eons of memory, a plurality of eggs never to be laid, all razed to the ground like hatchlings! All by beings we didn’t even know had the capacity to think. I know not where to turn, where to go to survive. Surely, [The Thinker] has hidden himself well, awaiting the time that he has gathered enough energy to Jump once again and be rid of this place. I might take solace in knowing that at least one of us might live on, might remember to warn others of this place. For now, I stay here with my work, etching my memory into the stone of the tallest mountain I could find. At least then, if another is to ever come here, they might know to flee before –  [Message ends here. Entity was destroyed by ICBM volley while in the process of engraving the stones of Everest. As of this date, all entities and birthing pods are accounted for, with only one escaping destruction when it fled to the sky from deep within the Amazon Rainforest.

"house tap water won't corrode electronics. Salt water will. The first thing you do when you drop something in salt water is to dunk it in fresh water then immediately dry it off. If OP lives in Florida or somewhere where he has a high iron content (red ring in your toilet bowl) in the water and it was left in the water long enough for the iron to get to the pcb, then he may have a problem.  This doesn't relate to compact electronics but I used to work with arcade machines and having soft drinks spill on them was commonplace. When you PCB (printed circuit board) gets soaked with sugar, it becomes a recipe for disaster. So the remedy was to take the PCB to the dishwasher and run it through then take the board and use the air compressor to dry it off. Works good as new after that."

"imo, there is no ""jump"" from an sv650 to a CBR600rr. more of a lateral shift than a leap up or down. the sv650 is probably a better bike around town and for most riding other than on the track. Vtwins make better torque at lower rpms and that means more power on tap as needed. take a look at this mess of a [torque curve chart](http://image.sportrider.com/f/9011991/146_0607_01_z+600cc_shootout+dynochart_torque.jpg). look at the yellow line, that is for the sv650. you see that hump between 6k and 7k rpm? that is what you loose going to a CBR600RR. i guarantee that hump is your best friend and you tend to hang out there, if you aren't shooting for 9k rpm and above. Notice that besides that hump the yellow line and the red line (Honda CBR600RR) lie pretty close together. PS: You should get a Superduke or a Speed Triple, if you want to ""jump"" into something that would be more powerful. Or if those are too big for you, 675_Daytona FTW!

"let me see if I can get this to work properly. &amp;#x200B; This is just a 5-8 minute walk down to the bridge and the stadium. [Entrance to Boyd parking lot](https://goo.gl/maps/RTZQPZxCBaK2) &amp;#x200B; This is the south campus deck that's basically across the road.  A little movie trivia for you, if you park here the quad just to the north of this deck can be seen in the movie Roadtrip. When they are first leaving the dorms and backing out into the road, it's Sanford drive and you can see this deck in the background (it looks different now as it has been expaded). [South Campus Deck](https://goo.gl/maps/Zj5g92vn3d22) &amp;#x200B; If you want easier access to downtown, the North Campus deck will be best, but I feel this one feels up faster than the others. &amp;#x200B; [North Campus deck](https://goo.gl/maps/wJyRaU55rk92) &amp;#x200B; Coming from SC, I would suspect you are going to come in on 441 from Commerce or 78 from the Augusta/Lexington direction. Both of these routes will take you to the north side of Athens and closer to the north deck. Getting to the other 2 lots/decks, just get on loop 10 when you get to Athens and head south/east. Get off on the College station exit and turn right. Take the first right off the exit and follow that around the Ramsey center. There will be a spot to vear off to the right, just on the other side of the deck, don't go that way, just follow it up to the red light. Go through the red light and all the way down to stegman coliseum (can't miss it) and turn right. The deck and lot will be down this road a few hundred yards. If you use say google maps to get to these two, I'm willing to bet it will try to take you through downtown, which is going to be heavy with traffic. Vehicle and pedestrian alike."
"yeah it does. it says it down on the picture that says ""comes with"" https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/a388a6f3-8d0b-4be1-bda8-3a9b55933bc4.jpg._CB291412530_.jpg now it says component but composite works too. just hook the yellow up to the red component"

4 was more specific for Elemental CB's. and I think +100% (effectively doubling) is worth the sacrifice of raw if facing an ele weak monster. Meant to be more of a niche skill. The specific numbers can vary But I wanted it to be a skill where if you hit 45/15 for CBs the benefits out weight the costs. For 5 I was thinking it would benefit GS more as it's easier for fast weapons to hit the wrong hitzone. But I guess they both have their advantages and disadvantages.  Oh and I thought of one more. 10. Sharpness Extender: Extends highest sharpness level x2 or x3 (don't want it too OP) but changes the rest of the sharpness meter to red. So you would either have white/purple sharpness or red sharpness.
Everyone is being pretty reasonable. The red card was right but hte reffing was shameful. God that red was so fucking stupid. Jones I'd forgive but I expected better of smalling at CB. To be fair though this is what we get by not having rafa or a true RB. Our huge problem is defenders that don't play enough and won't be good til they get that knowledge.
Got to keep playing it to Mane with their right sided CB on a yellow. He's so hard to tackle anyway and on a yellow it's even harder. Goal or a red would be huge
Heres How I did it as I stay away from CB for a while because it was complicated. 1. Pick a monster you know and enjoy fighting (High rank or low rank with appropriate weapon. No G-rank weapon to low rank monster) 2. Fight in sword mode only. Here you are practicing sword mode and when you should get rid of the glowing red sword. 3. Once u get used to that fight in Axe mode. (I only did this for a little while as I didnt really like it) Again to get used to fighting. Dont worry about charging your sheild or phials. 4. Fight monster with both Axe and sword mode. DO not worry about AED's at this point. This is to help you find your flow. 5. Practice GP's. Again Dont worry about AED's. JUst practice the timing of Guard points. You can move this up to step 4 if you like. I suggest tigrex for this one. Bring Guard +2 as well. 6. Practice the charge sheild AED to get the direction correct. Usually from a guard point. This is the most annoying part of learning the CB. 7. Practice aiming the AED on parts you want to hit. as well as learning sometimes you dont want to AED after a guard point. 8. practice SAED timing on monster. 9. practice aiming SAED on a monster. (useless for Ele CBs as how the phials explode is useless with aiming. )  I want to give a quick note that if you wish to feel the flow as fast as you can. Just do steps 2 and 5 first. The flow of the charge blade is based around know sword mode and knowing when to GP. This is followed by know how to do aim AED's but that is one of the harder things to nail down. As far as armor skills go just make sure you have Guard +2 and razor sharp. Once you get decent you should practice the monster without Guard to see how much knockback you recieve. Tigrex gives crazy knockback on guardpoints without Guard+2.
I have a red and white striped OCBD. What color pants should I wear with it. Navy is too Americana.
I haven't experimented with CBD yet but it looks promising. Are there any noticable side affects with CBD like regular cannabis (red eyes and such)?
I just recently found out that you can't Vape CBD oil (after I bought 2 bottles and a vape pen). Kind of found this out the hard way.. Vaped it for about 2 days now and was wondering why it wasnt consistent. When I first turn it on and heat it up it Vaped pretty good for a few puffs.. then after a while I'd get pretty much Zero Vapes.. ANYWAY.. did my research and turns out I need CBD VAPE oil.. boy is my face red ::rolled eyes::.. so although I'll keep putting the drops under my tongue like I was doing before I had the bright idea to vape.. can I put some kind of something in the oil to make it thinner to be able to vape (no nicotine) or do I just need to take this L and buy vape oil?
I know. I haven't even seen a red CBF when driving in the car.
I seen a red CBF pass me a few days ago when travelking in a car and nearly broke my neck looking for a GoPro cam on the riders lid.
I'm 23M in Strathmore on a white/red/purple CBR250RR. Add your bike to your flair from the side bar.
Is Blackmon the best red zone CB in the country?
Kinda wished they showed an elemental CB just to make sure it has the same Super AED animation. Also if red charges 5 phials then they nerved it because it charges 6 phials when you have loadup. I also wonder whats the difference between a guard point and a bushido style guard.
Man our CBs are pathetic outside of the red zone.

Moises is parting the RCB red sea.
Nice! Where at? My sister had my red JKUR on the beach this weekend too. And what CB antenna/mount is that? It looks sweet!
OMG! I had one of those. Bright red. Slant six. Three speed trans. CB radio.
Oh sweet. I'll keep an eye out for ya. I'm on a white/red/purple CBR250RR with a red screen.
Only if you take pictures of the TOC with FBCB2 screens on the projector with red header/footers...
Reddit used to sell t-shirts and they told us that the color was called orange-red on their web store. https://imgur.com/a/DhO7CBC
Rudolph the red nosed reindeer (1964) available OTA on CBS. Next airs on [10 December.](http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/rudolph-the-red-nosed-reindeer/tv-listings/191756/)
Shirt dick bib and unbuttoned untucked OCBD collar annoy me. Apart from that the fit of the clothes are good and colour coordination is decent. I do love me some red/burgundy.
That's a normal dragon crossbow. DHCB is not red anymore rhey made it like this yellow-green color
They even have poutine with CBS red-eye gravy.
What the fuck CBJ gets a single offensive push and naturally one of our players goes red alert right away to a penalty
Why should everyone be given such free protection from invaders? I get that you want to protect people as a blue spirit but there should be tradeoffs if you want protection. DS2 would have been fine if they had left a full red eye stone in the game. Without a full red eye stone there were fewer invaders meaning there was rarely a threat of being invaded so there was no reason to join the WoB. If threat of invasion was an ever-looming thing then more people would have been incentivised to go WoB and there would have been way more Sent action. Furthermore the more negs you pile on reds and perks you pile on blues the more people who don't feel strongly about a faction will go blue. It's what happened in DS2. It was a bitch to farm CREOs but CBEOs were fairly easy to come by. In addition the constant stream of spirits of vengence once you became one of the few sinners made reds far less appealing than blues. This means less sinners and overall less work for the blues. If you want more blue play the best thing you can do is make it more appealing to be a red than a blue. Stack the chips in favor of red invaders and the players who don't have a real preference will gravitate towards the covenant with more perks. Realistically there should be about twice as many reds as blues (maybe even more like 3X more reds than blues) for blues to get consistent play in their covenant.
Y’all motherfuckers are the real CB’s. Disney has ZERO obligation to donate a single red cent. Yet they donated $1 million and all y’all do is talk about how much they didn’t donate. I don’t wanna see a single fucking comment on this thread talking shit about Disney’s donation unless you’ve donated yourself. Talk about fucking irony. A bunch of people on a sub hating CB’s acting just like them. How is this any different than all of those people?? I’d love to hear your logic.
Yeah I'm thinking more of the 4 TE red-zone set. Clay harbor can jump. So you have 4 large targets at each corner of the endzone to exploit the weakest of the CBs / Safeties.
You only need Guard 1 on CB because red shield adds 2 and guard points add 2.
[those levers are these](http://www.amazon.com/Adjustable-Motorcycle-Clutch-Levers-CBR600RR/dp/B00CQNEZF0) which these are the cheaper kind. the kind you have might be legit's.... do yours wiggle per chance? like up and down? thats the only thing staying my impulse buy....the possibility of the dreaded wiggle. had a dirtbike with a wiggley clutch. no thank you. :l and nice to see you like em! I love the look of shorties. and that red is fabulous on your bike.
lol sick. i got a very similar setup. white '18 WRX &amp; red '75 CB360t
