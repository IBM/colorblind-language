green is green
On Saturday, I fell in the shower so my back was messed up. Then on Sunday, I woke up with the devil's stomachache. Apparently green tea just makes it worse .____. And today, I nearly passed out in the parade due to the heat and standing there for two hours.
I've done both. Either way it's shitty. My liq tolerance is fucked high but my weed tolerance is dogshit, so it feels the same. And the feelings I get from both are complete opposites, so you would think it would kinda cancel each other out, but coming from a guy that greens off of one goddamn bowl, the weed takes over and it's just bad.
It is a green cheek omg
can be colorblind and still see green normally.

When we first moved into our house EVERYTHING in the bathroom was lime green (toilet, bath sink, walls - the whole thing).
Can you explain how to not make it political if we need things changed in the world? A billion dollar business isn't going to cut into their profits by being green just because a Swedish 16 y/o asked them to. We need to make and 3nforce laws to do that.
I only distinguish my comments as mod when I'm speaking as a moderator, I'll do it with this comment. Most the time I'm just fucking around on the sub like anyone else, so no need to be green
As for what does Xbox smell like? Microsoft says the answer is fruit, herbs, and various styles of wood. ‚ÄúLynx Xbox is a fresh scent of pulsing green citrus, featuring top notes of kaffir lime and winter lemon, aromatic herbal middle notes of mint and sage, and woody bottom notes of patchouli and clearwood,‚Äù reads the product description. ‚ÄúContaining a range of natural essential oils, the Xbox Lynx range comes with a sleek new look and features a body spray, deodorant, and shower gel.‚Äù

Depending on where you live (To my knowledge) you can pick up basic antidepressants/anti anxiety meds without a prescription, I've been on some basic non-prescripted ones from walgreens for a little less than 2 months now and they do fine for me, I would suggest checking a nearby pharmacy for something like that. This is based off my own experience, so I'm sorry if it's not the right advice
I‚Äôve tried intermittent fasting, keto for the sake of it, paleo for the same reason, etc. Back when I ran track, I would do a juice cleanse for 1 week (only drinking a specific green juice). I‚Äôve found that dieting is one of those things I just do for the fun of variation. I‚Äôm at my healthiest when i‚Äôm eating clean and hitting 5-6 meals a day, 600-800 calories per meal depending on the time. Now, I mostly just eat IIFYM, but I‚Äôm bulking rn. On my cuts, I intermittent fast and eat one large meal thing (usually 3500/3600 cals) over a 4 hour window. Usually hit about 4100 cals during bulking szn. Edit: Stats - 5‚Äô10 and pretty. i like to round up to 5‚Äô11 but we‚Äôll ignore that lol. Weight: 135 -&gt; 160 - 151 -&gt; 188 -&gt; 162 -&gt; 174 currently, 13% BF.

You could always consider encouraging your parents to pick up green habits. You can recycle more if you already don't, eat less meat (you don't have to give it up), walk, bike, skateboard, scooter, etc, to class, turn off appliances and stuff when they're not in use, vote or have your parents vote with the enviorment in mind, etc.

Ah, in golf we refer to it as birdie (-1), eagle (-2), and albatross (-3). There's no term for 4 under because that literally means a hole in one on a par 5 and golf balls are limited to 200 mph speed to limit the total distance, making it impossible to drive the green in one shot on a par 5. That's actually why the Taylormade M6 used to be illegal because they had to use a speed foam injector to limit the maximum ball speed, otherwise it exceeded 175-200 mph maximum before that. For above it's bogey (+1) then the double, triple, quadruple, then we just say 5 over par,6 over, and etc at that point.

Goodbye green donut boy, best man Avdol, stupid dog. We will miss you.
So we had this university event that we wanted to post to our school portal (where you get all your school updates, assignments schoolworks and everything). However, there is this one school official who OBJECTED, just because we chose a sponsor (who he says was known for green washing, he is the Environment Resources head of the university) So I was like, how do we respond? What I did was comment a lengthy post that basically says "*this event has been approved (and this will still happen even if you object)*"

Could you link your vids next time, makes them easier to find 1) I don't, ever heard of the burden of proof? If I claim that, to use the famous example, there is a small green teapot orbiting Saturn, it is up to me to prove that, not you to disprove that. I find any of the variants more plausible than the resurrection. Heard of the Fatima "miracle"? Mass hallucination is a thing. Unlikely, but possible I find this the most likely, the video mentions a reliable historical source for his miracles, do you know of it? A lot of the alleged evidence against all of the above rest on the Bible, which is not fact. 2) He does. If you were an all powerful being, and you could save billions of lives with no effort, would you? A God that wouldn't doesn't seem worthy of worship. Not only does this contradict the previous point, it is disgusting. If God is all powerful, there must be a way for him to make the baby live AND that preacher appear 500 years in the future. If God can see the butterfly effect, he could have set up life in a way so that our cells are not vulnerable to cancer. If there is no way for good things to happen to everyone here on earth, how do you propose doing it in heaven. Final question: Do you believe in science when it comes to cosmology and evolution?

"""Good morning sunshine, I made you breakfast today!"" I beamed as I threw open the curtains to my son's room.  Tyler groaned, rolling around in his bed while mumbling, ""Mom?What time is it?""  I sat on the edge of his bed with a grin, ignoring his question, ""Breakfast is the *most* important meal of the day! You can't miss this, sweetheart. You wouldn't want to make Momma upset, would you?""  He groaned, ""No, but why are you doing this?""  ""Why? Well, I'll tell you, my dear.""  ""It helps provide you with proper nutrition to help get you through the day!"" While I spoke I began to tear away his blankets, earning whines in response.  As I continued to speak he sat up groggily, ""Breakfast helps to raise your energy level so you can perform your daily tasks with a smile on your face! I sure know that's how I like start my mornings.""  He rubbed his eyes and stood up. I quickly followed, putting my guiding hands on his shoulders as we walked to the kitchen. ""Where's Ashley?"" He asked lazily.  I furrowed my brow, ""Remember, she made Momma upset. You'll see.""  Tyler nodded and watched as I sat a huge plate full of food on it in front of him. An omelet, bacon, hash browns, pancakes, and some fruit. His eyes widened. ""Wow, thanks. Does this mean I'm the favorite child now?"" He joked as he took a spoonful of the eggs.  I watched carefully as he chewed it. His nose screwed up in disgust as he coughed slightly before spitting the some of the eggs out.  He looked at me with fearful eyes as he picked out a red finger nail from the eggs. His voice cracked as he spoke, ""Mom..? Where's Ashley?""  ""Oh! How did that get in there?"" I asked, plucking the nail from in between his fingers.  ""Mom.."" He said again, trailing off.  I shrugged, ""She made Momma upset, remember? Now go ahead and eat your breakfast like a big boy.""  His eyes widened and he looked to the basement door before glancing back at me and whispering, ""You didn't..? No... not like what you've done to dad... Did you?""  I leant down next to him, ""I did, my dear. I did. She was always a bad child, just like her father. You wouldn't wanna end up like them, would you?""  He shook his head violently and picked up his bacon and ate it with with a forced smile.  ""Good boy. You're not allowed to leave until you've eaten every single bite."" ~ [X] (https://www.reddit.com/r/sleepyskeletons/) [X] (https://sleepy-skeletonsblog.tumblr.com/)"
"""Good news, guys, I'm finally getting my condition fixed! My doctor was shocked that it wasn't dealt with when I was a child and said he'd never seen such a severe case, but when I explained to him I was raised by a couple of ignorant fucking red necks he understood. Anyway, just thought I'd let you know so that you don't worry about me being MIA while I'm trying to recover from surgery and repair the damage you did by being neglectful shitbricks."" Does that cover it? I know what you mean about your flaws being a part of you, though. Big changes are hard, no buts about it. Just take it one day at a time. Though with the added stress of having to become so resilient in the face of a barrage of cockfaces you may consider therapy; that's a lot of emotion that needs processing."
"""Hope you enjoyed it with your guy friend"" - immediate red flag. What the fuck does that have to do with anything?"
"""I don't feel the same way"" and ""There's too much going on in my life right now"" aren't vague answers, they're legitimate reasons a woman might not want to be in a relationship with someone. The fact that you view these answers as lies women tell to ""get out of a situation they put themselves in"" is kind of a giveaway that you have a hard time valuing a woman for her feelings and respecting her decisions. That may or may not be the case, but I'll just say that it's a huge red flag. How old are you? Depending on your age, the type of women you're surrounded by might not be interested in getting serious or settling down. There's nothing wrong with want a serious relationship, but you should be really upfront about it and not get involved with girls who aren't looking for the same thing."
"""Like my new hair color? It's a slightly different shade than yesterday's...I think tomorrow I'll try red."""
"""Make"" was the wrong word. This is what happens when red-light cameras are installed: people are afraid of getting a ticket so they stop when they can't safely do so. They're not necessarily rear-ended because they were being followed too closely; they're rear-ended because the person behind them was not expecting them to stop because they had plenty of time to get through the light and had to slam on their brakes in order to stop. I've been very nearly rear-ended at stop signs for the same reason -- nobody expects the person ahead of them to make a full stop. Yes, it's the fault of the person behind them. But the point is that red-light cameras do not make intersections safer. They're just a way for the city to get more money."
"""No"" is a complete sentence. You can just say no. This isn't about his feelings; this is about crossing boundaries. You can totally block and de-friend (and also make sure to have your sister block and de-friend). To make sure he gets the point, I would ALSO send a short message that says, ""You are really crossing boundaries. I am no longer at all interested in pursuing any relationship with you"". DO NOT be wishy-washy, though. If you think you're going to send a message that leaves *any* hope of a friendship open, it's better not to send one at all. This man is setting off your red flags, and he may well be dangerous. You need to be harsh. Dealing with creepers firmly is a good skill to learn. You'll need it often in life, so learn now."
"""Oh my god I wrecked my car, I'm covered in blood!"" Open can of red paint in the back seat. Edit: Also, you know this is reddit, right? You can say **fuck** here."
"""Ohhh you're so *embarrassed!*"" I mean maybe a little bit naw my face just goes bright red when I laugh."
"""Smart underachiever"" and ""soaks up information like a sponge"" are pretty big ""INTP"" red flags for me. INTPs, if you can excuse me generalizing, often present as pretty cold as well. Inferior Fe, if undeveloped, can cause a whole bunch of crazy emotional things depending on the person. What's interesting about this post is that ENFJ functions almost completely differently from INTP. The way the function stacks work is that you and him (assuming he is an INTP) share two of the same functions, Fe and Ti, but they're reversed. Your middle two functions are in the same order but the i/e part is switched. So you are Fe, Ni, Se, Ti; he is (theoretically) Ti, Ne, Si, Fe If you're pretty confident with the functions and the purpose they serve in what location, that can help you more accurately figure out his type. By the way you described him, I first see someone who is definitely Ti dom or Te aux. This narrows it down to INTP, INTJ, ISTP, or ISTJ. I really don't get Si or Se vibes from him, so I'm going to arbitrarily eliminate ISTP and ISTJ. As for the last two- I'm not fluent with how Ni vs. Ne influences a person, so I have to go by stereotypes. Is he organized? Punctual? Driven to complete stuff? Based on your description, probably not. Is he spacey? Lost in thought? Abstract? Probably. I'd give him like an 85% chance of INTP."
"""Tab targeting? Auto-attack? Seen it!"" This is the biggest red flag that a person has only seen videos or given the game a cursory glance."
"""You can't have a compliment, Anakin. I have the high ground!"" - A Star War, I think. Joking aside, this is really emotionally abusive behavior and is a giant red flag and you should definitely get out. I saw someone insinuating it may be mental illness, but the best bit of advice I ever recieved in my suffering of anxiety and depression was that ""you mental illness is not an excuse to be an asshole."" There is something obviously wrong with him and the way he thinks, but you should not have to take the brunt of the damage."
"""You're so mature for your age"" and variations on that theme are super common phrases used by older people to woo potential mates who are significantly younger. You can't see red flags online. They're super easy to hide. If you did go to another city to meet face-to-face someone you met online, you should pay your own way, don't tell them where you're staying, meet in public and do not go back to their place, and always make sure that you can get your own self back to where you're staying -- know how to hail a cab or which public transportation you can take, and make sure you have the means to pay for it. Make the meeting part of a larger trip that doesn't focus on them; have other things planned, maybe bring a friend on the trip (though not necessarily to the meeting)."

"#General advice Always haggle. Always always always. You don't get what you don't ask for. Always check prices. Use Reverb.com's Price Guide (disclosure: I write articles for Reverb for pay on occasion), check eBay's Completed Listings (you must be signed in), google the instrument and just see what comes up. Do not go by ASKING PRICES when negotiating; go by FINAL SELLING PRICE. Ask if there is a return policy. GET IT IN WRITING. If you don't get it in writing, there's no return policy. GET A RECEIPT with the seller's NAME AND CONTACT INFO if you are buying from Craigslist etc. If it turns out to be stolen, and you don't have a receipt and the contact info of the seller, you are generally SOL. If you are buying off Craigslist, MEET AT THE POLICE STATION. Many city police stations not only explicitly allow but encourage this. It scares off the scammers and protects both of you since you're both on camera. If you don't want to meet at a police station, meet somewhere public with cameras. If something feels funny, listen to these instincts. It is easy to get scammed/mugged/etc. If a deal sounds too good to be true, it probably is! #All guitars Check the *frets* and fret edges carefully, make sure they are not too sharp. Make sure that when you play the outer strings, they don't slip off the edge of the frets when you do vibrato. Make sure the frets are not pitted, rusted, loose, or uneven. If the guitar has had too many fret dressings, the frets will be smaller and may need to be replaced sooner rather than later. If it's had a refret, you should pay less for it as this means it's been well-used. However, a refret can add value to a guitar that needs one, if it's not a collectible/vintage guitar. Turn EACH **tuning key.** Make sure they turn smoothly and evenly and that they are not bent. Make sure they hold their tuning well and that alternate and drop tunings are stable and dial in quickly. Unless it's a vintage/collectible guitar this is a minor issue. Replacing tuning machines is common and easy if they are messed up, just make sure you pay less for it. Check the **nut.** Make sure it is cut well and doesn't have sharp ends or cracks. Make sure the intonation is good (the nut plays a big role). Replacing a nut is also not a big deal. Check the **headstock joint.** Make sure it has not been painted over or that it hasn't been cracked and repaired. (Well-executed repairs are stable and not a problem, but you should be paying less for a guitar with a broken &amp; repaired headstock). Gibsons are especially prone to snapped headstocks. A broken headstock, even if well repaired, should equal a MAJOR discount. Check the **top of the headstock.** If there are dings, scrapes, missing paint, etc, this means the previous owner was not so careful with taking it off and putting it on (hitting it against the ceiling) or walking around the house with it on a strap (against doorways) etc. This doesn't hurt the value IN ITSELF but it's an easy way to tell if a guitar has been played a lot. **GENERALLY I SEEK THIS OUT, IT IS A GOOD SIGN.** If a previous owner loved to play a particular guitar at home, it usually means it's a good one, and there's something special about it. Obviously you should pay a bit less for one that's dinged up, though, but when I'm buying a used guitar this is one of the first things I check for. **CHECK THE TRUSS ROD!** At the very least ASK about it. If you are buying online, do this over private message at minimum, so that you have it in writing. This is especially important for older guitars and custom/handmade guitars. It should turn smoothly and it should do what it's supposed to do. Don't downplay the importance of this! **SOME EASY NEGOTIATING POINTS** If you want a discount, you can make a fuss about any of these things when asking for a lower price: - A dirty guitar that you will have to clean up and recondition with lemon oil on the fretboard, wax, polish, detailing the frets, De-Oxit on the electronics if they the pots are scratchy, etc. Look over the finish very carefully, point out any dings, scratches, finish swirls, chips in the lacquer, checking, worn edges, faded hardware, rusted screws, etc. Make a big deal about having to ""clean it up."" Do the same with the case. - Make a big deal about original parts if ANYTHING has been switched out. If the tuners have been replaced, ask if they had to drill any holes to install the new ones. If the saddles have been replaced, ask if the originals are in the case or if they can mail them to you ""if they turn up."" If it's had any major mods ask who did the work and if the seller has the receipts for it. You should also ask the seller if they have a copy of the original purchase receipt in case there are warranty concerns or for insurance purposes. Ask if they filled out the warranty card or if they still have it, etc. - Even if you love it, find something you don't like. If I'm buying a used guitar, for example, I have a bad back and I bring a food scale (a small, battery-powered, digital scale that weighs up to 10 pounds very precisely) to weigh the guitar. This way I can complain about how ""my main guitar is only 5 pounds 10 oz"" if the one I'm buying weighs more, etc. (I legitimately do have a bad back; I don't say this just to make it up, but if I'm gonna buy a 7.5-pound guitar versus a 6-pound one, I'm gonna want a discount). If it's not the exact color finish you were seeking, say so, etc. I'm *NOT* saying to make things up just to get a lower price, but if it's not legitimately the perfect guitar for you, then you should bring this up so that you can sincerely offer a bit less for it and the seller will understand your reasoning and accept your lower offer. If you just throw out a lower price for no reason, it just becomes about money, and the seller is more likely to walk. - Some basic negotiating tips are ""don't negotiate against yourself,"" ""don't give up something for nothing,"" ""always be willing to walk away,"" ""if you need time to think about it, take your time."" Don't feel pressured to complete the deal if you don't like the deal. If you need 2 minutes or 5 minutes or 30 minutes to check stuff online on your phone, do it. If someone is pressuring you to close the deal fast, that is a red flag and you shouldn't do the deal. - If the seller wants cash, ask for a lower price. Most credit card services charge somewhere around 3-4% to process a card. You get certain protections from using a credit card or PayPal. DO NOT do ""PayPal gift"" if you're buying an actual item. The PayPal fees are the responsibility of the seller according to PayPal's terms of use. If the seller wants you to pay the fees, think of this as simply a higher price, and then they need to give up something else in exchange - maybe throw in a few sets of strings, or a nice strap, or both, etc. #Electric guitars Check the **electronics.** Plug it in! DO NOT BUY AN ELECTRIC GUITAR WITHOUT PLUGGING IT IN! I own a small battery-powered Roland Cube amp that I bring with me whenever I'm meeting someone from Craigslist etc. Test EACH PICKUP by tapping on it with a paperclip while it's activated to check the wiring. Test all configurations of switches to make sure they work and do what they are supposed to do. Check for buzzing and humming. If you are buying online, ask the seller to make a quick YouTube video demo'ing the electronics. You can also do this over video chat if that's easier for the seller. CHECK THE SCREWS - make sure that none of the heads are stripped or rusted out. Worn-off gold on hardware is fine, but is a sign of use, so negotiate commensurately. Check for any replaced parts‚Äîanything that's shiny if other parts are worn, anything mismatched etc. **ASK** about any repairs or replacements. Ask if it has the stock pickups, the stock saddles, the stock tuning machines, the stock strap buttons, the stock wiring, the original frets, etc. Ask if it's had any modifications. Ask who did the mods, if it was done by the seller, or a previous owner, or a local shop, etc. #Acoustic guitars Look closely and carefully at every square inch of the top (soundboard) for swelling, ripples, cracks (repaired or unrepaired), unevenness, etc. The wood should be neither too dried out nor too soft. Ask the seller if they used a humidifier and hygrometer, and about the conditions in which the guitar was kept. Look closely at the rest of the body and neck, too. Make sure that it it's clean and in good shape. Ask the seller what kind of polish they use. If there's a guitar cleaning cloth in the case, that's a good sign. If there's hand sanitizer in the case, that's a REALLY good sign, etc. **Often you can tell just as much about the history of the care of an instrument from interacting with the seller as you can from examining the guitar itself. Ask lots of questions. Talk about your musical tastes. Ask them why they're selling. Ask them what they are ""hoping"" to get for it rather than their ""asking price."" Don't make it all about money. Chat with them. When it's time to close, make sure you both feel good about it and make sure you have their contact info if you have further questions or need to follow up about anything. Ask them if they play in a band or if they have any recordings you should check out. This biz is all about supporting each other and growing the scene and networking - buying and selling gear is a great way to meet local musicians and discover new music, too!** Hope this helps."

"(21f) it comes from a lot of self hate and how I grew up. My parents had a fairly bad divorce so anything I see a red flag and I can compare it to my dad I RUN. My sister is ‚Äúthe pretty one‚Äù she‚Äôs 5‚Äô8‚Äù a size 2/4 long blonde hair and blue eyes at 16. I got my mothers genes and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù a size 12/14 with short (dyed) red hair and hazel eyes. I feel so gross compared to her. We went shopping today and EVERYTHING she tried on was really cute. I couldn‚Äôt even fit in a large anymore and my confidence is GONE. I feel like a huge whale. I‚Äôm crying as I write this. I‚Äôm in college and all my friends are in healthy relationships, engaged or married. I feel so worthless because I can‚Äôt and haven‚Äôt had a healthy relationship, ever really. I have a man who I adore and he adores me but he has a girlfriend. He‚Äôs my best friend and my rock but life just doesn‚Äôt want us together right now, maybe not ever. We both joke we will be each other‚Äôs second spouse but I want him as my one and only and I feel like he secretly feels the same way. This man remembers the little things like who does my nails, how much they cost, and how often I go! I know college is about learning but I figured I would have ONE healthy relationship by now. Sorry for rambling."
"(First of all I'm engaged to a non Ginger lol) But I'm a ginger female and I too got made fun of all of my childhood for my beautiful red hair. I was a really sensitive kid so it really hurt too. I always dreamed *all* of my life of growing up and marrying a red headed man. But unfortunately where I grew up there literally were none anywhere near my age!!! Unless I wanted to rob the cradle lol. I think that it's a negative stereotype about make gingers being unattractive because female Gingers seem to flood the market lol. My fiance is always telling me that he doesn't want us to have a red headed child if it's a boy. Because he believes the stupid and highly incorrect stereotype. Once when he was drunk he did tell me that if we had a red headed child it'd be a ""precious unicorn"", that it'd be sacred to him. And my fiance is NOT the mushy gushy tell me his every feeling kind of guy so this hidden revelation was of real significance and meaning to me. Trust me one day you'll find someone who will love the hell out of you and think that the sun quite literally shines out of your ass no matter what the color of *anything* on your body is. In the meantime just work on making yourself the kind of person you want to be someday. I hope that this helps :)"
"(From my extensive knowledge from Criminal Minds University) Most serial killers (that make a good story) have a purpose for their killings. It could be totally random, just a convenient wrong-place-wrong-time, no victim type, no killing style but who wants to read that? Maybe his parents were killed in a car accident because they were trapped and the car burned them, insert trigger that pushes him over the edge as an adult, now he kills anyone driving a red sedan by burning them alive. He could be reliving the moment and maybe he traps couples and tries to save them but he's always too late (maybe on purpose). He could be taking revenge. There needs to be a purpose."
"(Image caption:) A texting woman scraped the side of my car last week while I was at a red light and miraculously only damaged my rear arch reflector. I bought the replacement part and got behind my wheel to see that the rivet has been totally stripped (I'm the second owner so I'm assuming this was a botched job by the previous owner that they never revisited, the liner is a little warped as well). The driver's side rivet is in perfect condition, but of course I can't get into the side I need. Out Motoring has a screw/clip/rivet guide but I still can't seem to find this particular rivet anywhere, much less the serial number. Has anyone replaced it before? Anyway I can get something at an auto store and not wait another week for shipping? Thanks!"
"* Because they hate the Tories and wanted them to quit (20 year old who seemed to understand little about how politics works and thought they'd be forced to have an election) * Because it'd just fuck everything up and they liked the idea of that * Because they think that we're not allowed to trade at all with anyone other than Europe because of the EU. (This was just a 'fact' they thought they knew but had never given any thought to, as they realised it was obviously wrong the second I prompted them to think about it) * Because they think outside of the EU we can have free-trade with the whole world instead of just Europe (this person knew we could trade, but thought the EU imposed the tariffs to try and encourage trade within the EU and that without the EU it'd be free everywhere, therefore bringing prices down) * Because they think nothing will change and we'll retain all the rights, but we'll stop having to pay money into the EU (because they thought the rights were there by default because we were geographically within Europe and the payments were something we opted into to help rebuild after WW2 and they thought weren't necessary anymore) * Same again, but instead of retaining the rights by default we'll retain them because the EU knows it will collapse without us and will just let us keep them anyway * Because they think Europe curtails their employment rights, restricts how many days they can have holiday and was responsible for them losing their job after spending 6 months on sick (heard on a local radio phone-in before the referendum rather than real conversation) * Because they think Europe forbids us from deporting criminals and terrorists if they have a cat (heard this one a few times, mostly in the run up to the referendum) * Because they think the EU is the Forth Reich/Hitler by the back door/something something Nazis (also one I've heard a few times) * Because they think Tony Blair wants to control us using Europe, or something, it was hard to make sense of this particular rant * Because they think that we're the Bestest and Most Important‚Ñ¢ country in the world and the EU is a tether holding us back from being the Greatest World Super Power The World Has Ever Seen‚Ñ¢ * Because they think there are too many Asians moving into their neighbourhood and enough is enough * Because they think there's too much red tape for small businesses despite having never had a job in a small business or a job that would put them into contact with 'red tape' or apparently ever having a conversation with someone who did have experience with in this area and remembers how much worse it was before the EU  My hobby: Listening quietly to people ranting. Sometimes deliberately antagonising them depending on who it is, but usually just listening and trying to give as neutral a response as possible. Village pubs full of old and middle aged people who hang around at the bar talking to anyone that comes close are fantastic for this."
"* Being very lazy. A man that half-asses everything else will definitely half ass the relationship as well. * Ignoring my opinion on things and telling me flat out ""you're wrong"" when I am expressing my opinion on a controversial subject. * Severe unwillingness to try new things, whether it be new experiences, different foods, different types of movies. Being set in their ways. * Being rude to other people. Especially to their family and also those who serve them. * Manipulation. * Marginalizing my needs and feelings. Also a small note, if/when I meet the family, if I do not like the way the parents interact with each other or I have a negative gut feeling about their family I immediately review how important the relationship is to me and assess how much of those actions might surface in our own relationship once he gets comfortable. **Edit for clarification**: In regards to the family, I intended to mean this is a potentially huge red flag to take note of, not a deal breaker."
"* Breakfast - coffee w/ creamer ~150c * Lunch - leftover beef goulash and red cabbage ~250c * Snack &amp; Dessert 16 oz OJ ~210c * Dinner - Grilled Chicken &amp; Green Beans ~350c Swam for 30 minutes, about 200c burned? I think 900 not calculating the cardio, since I don't actually know what that's burned. Not a bad day!"
"* Condoms are 10 for $1 at the Lifestyles Center. The Lifestyles Center is awesome. No, I am not just saying that because I work there. * Be on the look out for Toilet Talk. You will know what I am talking about when you get here. * Every Thursday there is Open Mic Night in the library cafe. It is a great way to see the talent we have on campus and meet new people. * Hockey is HUGE. Be ready. * I took English 102 with Bob Early. He was a really chill guy. * Patricia Michel (History Professor) looks like Jabba the Hutt. And she goes off on these really boring stories that make you wanna die. * Look for the red wagon. People will give you free stuff. * Don't just find freshman friends. Not gonna lie, that will be too much drama. * Work at forming new habits. College is a lot different than high school. * Connect with people in your classes. It will be good to have connections if you miss class or need some help. * Tutoring is FREE. Take advantage."
"* I want to play WoW on ultra, Skyrim almost perfectly, TERA, GW2, CS:GO, LoL, Minecraft (my processor sucks for it), other misc MMOs.  * $1000  * This weekend. Prime time, I expect.  * Tower, Monitor (at least 1, 2 if there's some really good deal, but only 1 is necessary. 1920x1080 please), OS (Windows 7)  * I do not. US.  * I will be keeping my HP keyboard, Razer Naga (MOBA version), and Plantronics headset until the spring when I get paid again.  * I will not. Too much of a noob to that kinda stuff.  * SSD definitely. I don't know what all that other stuff means. I just wanna be able to play my games without all this lag and FPS drops to 3.  * I would like a medium to small tower, not a huge one. I only have so much space. I saw this really awesome purple/white case that I loved, but I dunno if it'll be the best price. Anything with some color that pops, just not red. As long as it's not red, I'll be fine.  * I do, Windows 7.  * Nothing really except thank you for taking the time to put something together."
"* If you're on PC, I'm a Glaive main that's solo'd everything except Behemoth cause screw that noise (but I might try with MR weapons/armor), and I can probably play with ya. * Buffs. If you aren't keeping your kinsect buffs topped off, your overall performance dips. You notice fairly easily as the red buffs gives you more moves, and you get more movement speed / extra air jumps with white, and orange is decreased stamina consumption. Since the extra moves are gone the moment the buffs are, it's hard to not keep them topped up. * Try to stay on the ground, fellow helicopter. It's fun to fly, and sometimes necessary for wing breaks or Rathalos, but on the ground is where your true DPS is. That being said, buzzing around can proc ailments a LOT because of the flurry of hits. Figuring when to fly and when to ground is key. * Like mentioned elsewhere, abuse the clutch claw for free knockdowns. However don't forget to get mounts and use the tailraiders where possible. (Shelling from Gajalaka works on Elders! I think Boaboa Spears works too.) * Upgrade the armor. Even if you don't think you are running around a lot, you are. Make sure you're doing Steamworks for armor spheres and maxing out the armor value to make you able to last through hits. Also keep an eye on your set's resistances and skills so they're useful to your next fight. Trying to fight Namielle with armor that has negative water and thunder resistances will bite you in the aft. * Try switching up your weapon. The Guild weapon isn't too bad by looking at it, save the hidden element (I think we're talking about the same weapon), though I haven't played it given I maxed out the Velkhana, Brachi, Rathalos, and Namielle for a reasonable elemental selection. Instead of element, try out ailments. Blast is fun. (I avoid hidden elements personally. They're a pain.) * If you're soloing, make sure you're getting extra tailraiders. They help out a whole helluva lot, and now leveling them up is even more important. Just plonk down the Boaboa's tailraider signal when you start! * MANTLES. Even if the Temporal got nerfed, it's great to put on when the monster rages. Take either a booster or a mantle to counteract the element of certain monsters. Iceproof and Waterproof are my most used. Do the quests to upgrade them so you can get gem slots on them. Waterproof is basically necessary for Namielle and Iceproof for Velkhana. * Your palico. It does help a lot! Giving your cat at least decent armor is helpful- just not priority, good armor will keep it from stopping to heal too much, lowering performance. Your cat's weapon can proc ailments 1-2 times a fight. I keep Sleep weapons on my cat, and get at least 2 sleeps on a monster if the fight lasts more than half an hour. Their gadget can be very helpful- I just started with the Meowlotov after a long, long time in using the Plunderblade. * Get you some charms. I use an Earplug charm so I always have earplugs. I got through base game without it and now I'm seeing what the hype is about. I ignored charms a while then started using them. So good."
"* Milani Amore Matte Lip Cream in Crush - sheered out, this is a beautiful MLBB shade on my pigmented lips. Full on it is a gorgeous brick red that leans more brown. * Colourpop as a whole - damn, I am impressed with the quality considering the price + hype wagon. The fall collection was EVERYTHING. Favorites include Blood lippie (my go-to red of the moment) and Poison which is another beautiful brick red that looks subtle on me, ugh and Dazed is such a pretty berry pink. I like everything basically lol. Their cheek products are not my favorites, however. * Maybelline Dream Wonder Matte Powder - I think this is the name? I got this back in summer and already I hit pan. I use this underneath my eyes (I stamp it with either a makeup sponge or a dense brush and then brush away the excess with a fluffy brush) and it helps my concealer to stay on all day and prolongs creasing. The reason why I use this powder and not a loose translucent powder is because with some concealers I found that I actually need more pinkiness for the product to match my skintone and the Maybelline powder is wonderful at doing that plus adding some coverage as well. I don't think it helps me stay matte though, for that I like the Rimmel Stay Matte Primer."
"* Stila liquid lipstick in Fiery - when I want something that stays put in a ""true"" red. * NARS velvet matte lip pencil in Dragon Girl - when I want something comfortable but long lasting and a bit more casual, since on me it's a slightly more pink looking red. * KVD Studded Kiss in Hexagram - I love the formula of these bullets and this is my favourite of her reds. * Besame Chocolate Kiss, Makeup Monsters Terracotta, and KVD Studded Kiss in Lolita II - when I want a more brown, or muted, or brick/terracotta shade and not a classic red."
"* Their writing. Is it coherent? Does it have spelling or grammatical errors? If the message is badly written, I won't even bother looking at the profile. * Their pictures. Are they badly-lit or pixelated? Do they know how to choose good pictures? * Height: I don't care as long as they're at least my height (5ft4). I have yet to get messages from guys that are shorter than me, so I don't know how I would react in that case. * Weight: I don't mind if they are slightly overweight. * Profile: Writing aside, I look out for common interests (gaming, programming, geeky stuff) and a somewhat intellectual disposition. However, I also want to see some indication of outdoor activity as I like doing those sometimes. I like a dry/sarcastic sense of humour, but I'll be turned off if the profile tries too hard to be funny. Profiles which are overly negative are a red flag. * Questions: If they're conservative, I probably won't think that we're a good match. The shaving legs question is a red flag if they answer Yes."
"* They are rude/mean to wait staff and service workers * They start insulting you during an argument rather than discussing the issue * They never want you to go out without them, constantly suspicious of your activities * They act passive-aggressively rather than discussing an issue reasonably * Guilt trip you into doing something you don't want to do * They don't respect your boundaries * They show up unannounced when you're out with friends, or at your work, etc. * Talks bad about her friends when they're not around As many have said, basically the same red flags as men."
"* the ordinary coverage foundation. despite its name, i still find it more of a sheer-medium coverage foundation that lasts during really hot days and doesn't ever look dry or bad for me. i love it. * tf sweetie pie bronzer. something warm and sunny for the season! * becca vanilla quartz highlighter. it confuses me because it looks almost like a cool gold, almost green and silver and gold all at once.. i know that doesn't make sense but it is brightening and warming and lovely all at the same time. * lorac mega pro. i forgot i owned it BUT i fell back in love. i haven't used much else for a few weeks. * bite's new lipstick from the spice things up collection, ""lit turmeric."" it's like an orange/red and coral all at once, muted and still summery. i can't stop wearing it."
"**Alternate Friends Title** - The One where Philip Channels His Inner Barney Stinson **Random Thoughts** - Word of the Day - Gelignite: an explosive - Rhodesia is today‚Äôs Zambia and Zimbabwe. My favorite Agatha Christie book is set there. It‚Äôs called *The Man in the Brown Suit*. - This is the start of Philip‚Äôs lunch club. Ish is about to get real. - The age difference between Peter and Margaret does have a bit of an ick factor to it. She was 17 when they were making googly eyes at Philip and Elizabeth‚Äôs wedding. He was 32. - I don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs so unreasonable that Peter and Margaret wait to marry. It‚Äôs two years. Not that big of a deal. - They keep mentioning how Elizabeth dug her heels in and got the man she wanted to marry. Could we have a flashback of that please? - This episode makes it seem like Elizabeth doesn‚Äôt like sharing the limelight with Captain Townsend. Correction: Doesn‚Äôt like sharing the limelight with Margaret. - This is the first time I didn‚Äôt like Elizabeth. I‚Äôm not a huge fan of Peter but she‚Äôs going above and beyond to keep them from seeing each other. It‚Äôs really unnecessary. - I really didn‚Äôt like Tommy the first time I watched the series but I‚Äôve really gained an appreciation for him the second time around. He‚Äôs a straight up boss. - God Save the Queen is totally My Country Tis of Thee. - That phone system! Thank goodness for technological advances. It must have taken forever to make a phone call back in the day. - I am 100% not approving of Philip‚Äôs cheating on Elizabeth (if that‚Äôs even what happened), but it makes sense. **Idle hands are the devil‚Äôs workshop.** Philip doesn‚Äôt have anything meaningful to do with his life. His job is gone. He can‚Äôt really help Elizabeth with her work either. He‚Äôs bored. Is it such a surprise he‚Äôs spending his time drinking, partying, and whatever else he might be doing? - And we end the episode with Wallis‚Äôs evil cackling. **Stuff I Learned about British History*** - *Were Farouk‚Äôs red car killings a real thing?* Farouk was a total baller but also legit crazy. He once shot lions in a zoo because he‚Äôd had a nightmare about them. One article I read said he was a clepto who had pickpocketed Churchill‚Äôs watch. He lived a lavish lifestyle. And yes, people got out of the way when they saw one of his red cars. There‚Äôs rumor that an ambulance followed behind him to pick up casualties. *Historical accuracy not guaranteed. Also by learned I mean Googled. **Favorite Quotes** - ‚ÄúDesperately dull. I‚Äôm confident I‚Äôve met more interesting plants.‚Äù - ‚ÄúTick. Tick. Tick. Bon voyage.‚Äù - ‚ÄúYou reap what you sow sister.‚Äù **Questions** - Do you think Margaret was right? Do you think Elizabeth is jealous of Margaret and worried about her eclipsing her? - Do you think Philip cheated on Elizabeth during their marriage?"
"**Base:** Glossier Skin Tint + Cle de Peau Beaute Concealer + By-Terry Touch Expert Advanced Concealer (for the undereye area). When I want to ""impress"", I'll switch the Skin Tint for the Giorgio Armani Luminous Silk. **Powder:** Besame Violet Brightening Powder &gt; everything else. **Brows:** Anastasia Brow Wiz + Benefit 24-HR Brow Setter Shaping &amp; Setting Gel (LOVE this product; it's got a cult following but is still underrated, IMO). **Eyeshadow:** Most days, I just use the RMS Buruti Bronzer! Barring that, maybe a Tom Ford Cream Color for Eyes pot (favourite is Platinum, personally). For the record, my favourite (and only full-sized) palette is the Laura Mercier Eye Art Artist's Palette, which I also reserve for special occasions. **Eyeliner:** Pur On Point Eyeliner in Hotline (described as a ""metallic hunter green"", but it's really quite dark brown). Nobody ever talks about it, but it's self-sharpening and really comfortable to wear, plus has good longevity. **Mascara:** Not a big mascara person, but I'll use the Glossier Lash Slick if I'm feeling a little more ~flirty~. Curler-wise, it's team Muji all the way &gt; Shiseido or Shu Uemura. **Blush:** It's a toss-up between Glossier Cloud Paint in Dusk, the ILIA Multi-Stick in Tenderly, and the Tarte Amazon Clay blush in Paaaarty. **Bronzer:** RMS Buruti Bronzer. *Sometimes* I'll switch over to the Guerlain Terracotta Light Healthy Glow Vitamin-Radiance Powder, which is multi-faceted enough to serve as a sort of blush/bronzer hybrid. **Highlight:** Glossier Haloscope in Quartz, most days. Charlotte Tilbury Beauty Light Wand if I'm feeling fancy. **Lip Balm:** My all-time fave is the Dior Creme Rose, which costs an arm and a leg for how little product you get, and which no-one ever talks about. I usually rotate Glossier Balm Dot Coms instead. Coconut is my favourite flavour. **Gloss:** Fenty Gloss Bomb in Fu$$y. For a more sophisticated look, I'll use the Lancome L'absolu Gloss in Rosy Plump (clear with a wash of pink). **Lipstick:** Ugh, such a tough category. I'll go with my top five, in no particular order. Bobbi Brown Crushed Lip Color in Telluride (the formula is wonderful and so unique); Charlotte Tilbury Matte Revolution in Very Victoria (don't love the formula, but my best nude); Marc Jacobs Le Marc in Miss Scarlet (another ""meh"" formula but a *wonderful* matte deep red); Dior Baume Natural Lip Treatment Makeup in 688 Diorette (super wearable formula; beautiful bright rosy pink colour; *discontinued*); and the Revlon Ultra HD Matte Lipcolor in 645 Forever (another one no-one talks about, but it's got a super creamy formula and a wonderful terracotta rose shade)."
"**Cloud Paints:** Cute but finicky tube; will always squeeze out too much product. Formula is gel-like bordering on watery. I find the lighter shades very easy to blend and the darker ones to be a bit patchy - my personal favourite is Dusk; I also quite like Beam and Puff; I decluttered Haze. One layer will add a wash of colour, but they're easy to build up. Longevity on my skin is 4-6 hours, but they fade nicely. **MILK Baked Bronzer:** Formula is lovely; shade leans a bit... yellow? May suit some undertones better than others. Easy to blend out, though, for a natural flush. Sort of a satin-y finish. As others have said, the scent is quite Play-Doh-y; I personally find it distracting. Longevity is decent; 8+ hours. I'd get the mini if I were you because the regular is gigantic. **CT HFF:** I feel like this product has been talked about ad nauseam by me and other members of this community. It's beloved for a reason. Very versatile; you can use it as a glowy primer, sort-of foundation, mixer, and highlight. Key selling point is that it simply looks stunning over the skin. **Gloss Bombs:** Very popular product; texture is thick without being tacky. Also very moisturizing, which is why I like it. Lips end up looking very plush. Longevity is not great; the thickness makes it somehow easy to wear off. Good value; plenty of product in (rather chunky, but cute) tube. Will not fit into the back pocket. Both Fu$$y and Fenty Glow are nice - there's not a lot of tint. Fu$$y is cooler; Fenty Glow is more of a warm nude. **CT Lipsticks:** Haven't tried Hepburn Honey but own Bond Girl. Lovely red-berry shade; flattering on many different skin tones. Comfortable soft matte formula - not as comfortable as creamier lip formulas, but very comfortable as far as a matte formula goes. A bit pillowy, to be honest. I haven't noticed any textural issues on my lips but other people have noted it. Average longevity but I personally find it fades nicely. **Becca Under Eye Corrector:** I must be the only person who didn't totally love this - found the formula actually had a bit of... shimmer (?) in it that made me say meh. Quite luminous, which some people like but I don't. Abysmal shade range, but the (two!) shades will be splendid if you're between an NC15 and NC30. Great longevity. Doesn't crease on me, but few things do."
"**Common Brimstone's Vampire Hunter** (today is the last day to get it!). It's gorgeous, the first indie I've gone and bought full size (though I'm thinking of a Smoke and Mirrors fullsize soon, this is just vanishing soon). Smells like hot buttery popcorn on me, dries down to something a bit woodier and more subtle but there's still the buttery popcorn smell. I love it so. (And I suck at perfume revieving, sorry) also **FF Candied Apple** because favourite duochrome for the season ever, beautifully soft and I can wear it every day at work. Pkus the red/green really works for my eyes. Aaand **Shiro I Loved A Maid** because it's a darker, punchier version of Candied Apple to me. Especially with PE or Glitter Glue."
"**Damek**: Slavic variant of Adam... literally means ""son of the red earth,"" but as in referring to the first human, Adam. **Jovan**: Slavic variant of John... Jovan also means ""majestic, or Jove-like"", Jove being another name for Jupiter, king of the Roman gods. **Ziven**: I personally really like this one... Another Slavic name, meaning ""lively"" or ""vigorous"". **Tomik**: Slavic variant of Thomas, which literally means ""twin"" but is a reference to one of Jesus' disciples, I believe. **Lucian**: Similar to Lucas, it's a Latin name meaning ""light"". Could also be given the French spelling of ""Lucien"". **Logan**: Similar in some ways to Lucas, Warren, and Calvin, this is a Scottish name meaning ""small hollow"", and it's got the badass seal of approval because it happens to be Wolverine's name too! **Archer**: Similar to Arthur, English name with the literal meaning of a ""bowman"". **Augustine**: Similar to August, but with a twist and a bit cooler sounding than Augustus... It's a variant of Augustus, and it means ""great"" or ""magnificent"". Hope that helps some!"
"**Delivery alone** will cost $10k, on the cheap side. http://www.costhelper.com/cost/child/baby-delivery.html You can skimp and save, but babies are fucking expensive. A lot of people simply don't have the money to have a kid. Your arguments seem to be based on a theoretical fantasy-land. You're like a Communist. Right up until the end of the Soviet Union, and even today, Communists will say, ""it will work, we just need to keep trying!!"" Communists supposed a system based on a fantasy - namely that everyone would perfectly work together and pull their own share, no one would be corrupt and we would all live in a magical hippy wonderland. You're the right-wing version of that. You're believing a libertarian fantasy. We're talking the real world. You have your own fantasy - that the entire society can pull themselves up by their bootstraps and becomes wealthy, self-reliant producers. Well here's the death of that fantasy: we can't all be business owners. Every business owner in America becomes rich off of people making far less than him. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but in any society, you're going to have a lot of people working low-level poorly-paying jobs. This isn't because they're lazy or uneducated. If everyone gets a doctorate, then you will address the McDonalds cashier as doctor. Someone has to do these jobs in society. There's no way around it. We're going to have tens of millions of people earning the equivalent of $15-20k. **This is the inevitable, unavoidable reality of capitalism. Deal with it.** And the ""principle behind your debate"" of ""why is it OK to lay burdens, no matter how great or small, upon those who do not agree to accept the burden"""" **BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT A GOD. YOU LIVE IN THIS SOCIETY AND ARE PART OF IT. ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER** So, what are the practical realities here? Well, it's all well and good to say, ""if you can't afford kids, don't fuck!"" One problem there. **You are fighting 4 billion years of biological evolution. People WILL fuck. I'm sorry. It's going to happen. Any plan that starts with ""just don't fuck"" is as great a fantasy as Communism.** So, what happens then? Obviously people are going to fuck. Millions of people who can't afford kids are going to fuck. As a practical reality, what do we do? Well, the people themselves cannot pay for this. High ideals and fantasy theories be damned. We don't live in magical fairy land. On this Earth, you have three choices in this situation: 1. Fund contraception and allow poor women to control their reproduction. The vast, vast majority will not choose to conceive kids they can't support. 2. If you don't fund contraception, then be prepared to pay for the kids. Food stamps, housing assistance, public education. 3. If you're a heartless bastard and toss the kids on the street, be prepared to pay the costs for massive crime. I hope you like living in a bunker. When broke parents are faced with a starving child, what do you think they're going to do? They're going to come to your house and take your stuff. If not that, some charismatic Lenin-type figure will appear and offer the desperate masses a real Communist revolution. Not the ""Obama is a socialist!!!!"" type, but an honest-to-god red parades and gulags revolution. Like it or not, we are in this together. You will end up paying for the poor, one way or another. You can either pay for it in the cheapest way possible (contraception primarily), or you can watch as the tens of millions of jobless, uneducated, starving people you created overthrow your government, take your stuff, and send you off to some reeducation camp. That's the end game. Remember the old saying, ""all civilizations are three missed meals away from a revolution."" If you are not willing to ensure some basic level of subsistence for the poor, then a charismatic, tyrannical leader will inevitably emerge who will. /rant"
"**Do you think this type of man would subscribe to a Red Pill viewpoint?** He might, he might not. I imagine that if it does then it would not be as much of a conscious effort as some of the people on here, he would be naturally dominant, perhaps not even aware of the red pill. **Which traits** I think the vast majority of women have been raised with an inbuilt sense of...superiority for want of a better word. It's seen all the time in wives and girlfriends who will bitch and moan about their SO, about how they can never get anything right, about how ""hohoho men are useless!"" ""haha men are such children!"" "" I don't have a husband i have another child"" and it really grinds on me, I can't comprehend how they can say these things about the men they're supposed to love, I think women find it normal to take control in their relationships, their men will go out with friends ""If the mrs lets me"" and if that works for them and they're both happy then great but I never truly believe that the man is happy like that. I think women have decided that men don't really need love and affection, that they don't need to reminded of how super amazingly manly they are, they've decided that men can fend for themselves and make themselves feel good while having to shower the women with compliments everyday and tell her ""no sweety you're not getting fat"" when she is. I think women have a distinct lack of accountability, they get angry at the truth, they say they're being emotionally abused when their SO, or anyone else for that matter, tells them their flaws. Women say ""Oh he should love you as you are, you dont need to change for anyone"" when actually, most people do need to change, people need to make compromises to spend their life with another human being and what's more, people **should** be striving for improvement. Basically I think women these days would prefer to be lied to and to lie to themselves rather than admit that they have a flaw that they need to put the effort in to correct, a husband should be able to say ""I still love you dearly but you have put on weight"" because the truth is that he preferred her, and fell in love with her while she was active and had a fit body and she should want to keep him sexually attracted but that just can't happen these days. I just don't think women treat their men they way men should be treated, women think they're putting in all the effort and trying the hardest when really they're not doing anything the man wants and she never cares to ask what he wants, then if he dares open his mouth to tell her what he wants she'll flip out because she's already put in so much effort and gotten no appreciation for it....why should she get appreciation for something nobody wanted her to do in the first place? I just think women need to be kinder, gentler and more loving toward their men, maybe they should take time to shower him with compliments, maybe she should initiate sex and show him that she physically cannot keep her hands off him, maybe instead of bitching she should boast about him to everyone, she should realise and most importantly **show** that he is simply the most amazingly man to ever walk the fact of this earth and everyone else should be hugely jealous of this absolute hunk that she's got, there's no reason on this earth to make him feel anything less. Wow that was an essay, sorry. **What do you think they do that falls under the heading of 'trying too hard to be masculine?'** Power dressing is one although this is probably personal preference but i really hate seeing a woman in an unflattering pant suit, I just think women have this whole amazing range of beautiful clothing to wear and they don't utilise it. Looks are our first impression and we can make so much more of that, we can walk into a room and command the attention and respect of every person in there while still looking like a woman. However I will concede that if she's comfortable then fine...I personally go for style over comfort but I wouldn't want to make anyone uncomfortable against their will. I just think women don't use the numerous advantages available to her, we don't need to be one of the guys, we don't need to be uncompromising, we don't have to put our foot down and make it clear that we are the boss. Women have an ability to be sweet, demure and likeable and that is what gets a man's respect. But like the president thing, if she can do it and do it well then I'm not bothered about how she's doing it.  **What do you think of men generally?** As with women there are good and bad ones, there are some lovely gentlemen and there are some colossal douchebags. Generally I don't think men are as hard to get along with as women, although I'm not the type to have a big group of male friends. I think men can accept that they need to make improvement and they will make them, I think men put a lot more effort in to their relationships, they make their women feel loved and beautiful even when she looks like a troll, I think men are more forgiving and unfortunately I think men have become weak but I think that's the fault of women, I think we've beat them into submission and then moaned that there's no ""real men"" left."
"**Gender, continent, and looks (optional)** Female, Europe (UK), usually pretty average, can probably hit 7/10 with good make up. **Post your pill (or lack thereof)** Mostly red with the occasional point of disagreement **Explain your view point in a few sentences.** Women have stopped treating their men well, stopped being deserving of good treatment and yet come to expect to be treated like a princess just because - this needs to stop. Women need to worship their men and and revel in the delightful happy relationship that they'll receive when they find the **right man** to treat like a king. **Why do you believe what you believe?** Because I spent my younger years (admittedly I'm only 21 years old) being the self entitled princess and saw the all the ""nice guys"" falling at my feet, begging me to stay with them aaaand I got bored. I mistreated them and didn't respect them and it was horribly wrong. After being with someone who takes no bullshit my interest lasted much longer and the happiness came when I respected that. **What don't you understand about the other perspectives?** I do understand the other perspectives - everyone likes what they like and should do what makes them happy as long as they're not hurting anyone else. What I don't understand is the outrage they aim towards red pill as if it's any of their business what other people are doing in their happy relationships or who they're having sex with.  I also don't understand, despise and am probably irrationally offended by the blue pills who say RPW are into kink and are in a permanent dom-sub relationship because...what the fuck do you know about my relationship? My SO is about as beta/blue pill as they come and I do stupidly take it personally when those people imply that my relationship is somehow wrong or ""kinky."""

"**Laughing at Trump is how he won**. Democrats thought this was a fucking game. They gave this dude free press by circulating memes and giving him free air time. They didn't take him seriously. They thought his supporters were a minority of freaks, not a viable voting bloc. They sat on their hands in liberal strongholds like LA and New York and made comedy specials about how it's obvious that building a wall is ridiculous. Look, blue state liberals: your dismissiveness of Republicans doesn't do you any fucking favors. It may be obvious to you and your friends and neighbors that homeless people don't deserve to starve to death, and you can fight over how many new shelters you should build this year. Meanwhile, in red states, liberals fight tooth and nail to shut down Crisis Pregnancy Centers that trick girls into keeping pregnancies with lies about abortion, keep underfunded shelters open, and convince people that banning puppy mills is okay, and letting people smoke weed without serving 50 years in prison won't result in the end of the world. Hollywood and NY is totally out of touch with the rest of the country. They think Trump is hilarious, that he could never win. My state elects militia men and Nazis to state government, and we're not even in the South. Don't do a victory dance when the rest of the country is languishing under the rule of Republicans who have gutted their state economies. Start giving a shit about the work red state liberals do, and why we don't think Trump is funny. Or maybe even why we backed a pragmatic progressive over an atheist socialist. We work hard despite a rigged game and know that we can only made modest improvements so long as we keep our heads down and work hard. Had we worked harder to elect our nominated candidate and demolish her opposition this wouldn't have happened. Instead we breathlessly devoured meaningless conspiracy theories that didn't have any connection to actual corruption and gave a fascist free press. I hope every liberal in this stinking country who thought the worst of Republican ideology was just a memory takes a long hard look in the mirror and figures out that throwing people under the bus for a good meme is not a goddamn joke."
"**Laura Mercier Caviar Stick in Rose Gold:** this is my go-to for when I am in a rush in the morning but IM(unpopular)O, they really don't beat out my other shadows in any one level... they don't crease, they apply smoothly, and they are easy to blend, all without primer, which makes them amazing for last-minute makeup but all my other shadows perform similarly when I have time to prime and blend them. They definitely live up to the hype in terms of in-a-rush makeup but if I have time to spend on my makeup, I don't see myself reaching for these over any of my other shadows unless I am going for the color, which I absolutely LOVE. Might get the Sugar Frost one just to keep it in my travel suitcase forever. **Sephora Angled Brush #90:** well ladies I found my new eyebrow magic wand. Best angled brush I have tried - stiff bristles, no stray hairs, no spreading... going to order a few more for gel liner :) **Hourglass Mineral Veil Primer:** I wanted this product to be 100% hype because it is so expensive... but I love it. I love it so much I might marry it. Help, because it's $50 for the full version and I am almost out of the travel one I bought a month ago... **Smashbox Under Eye BB Cream:** I hate the applicator, I hate how orange the lightest shade is, I hate how chalky it dries, I hate the matte black packaging that picks up all the junk in my makeup bag, I just hate this product. It cracks through the day and my boss asked me if my allergies were acting up last time I wore it because my eyes were red from me brushing off product all day and that was my last straw. Booooo this product."

I 100% only bought this because I *loved* creepypasta when I was in high school and had no idea how it was going to smell (most reviews I read just said it was a weird experience haha). I definitely get like high school pre-party vibes from this though, just like Smelly Yeti's Princess Jellyfish gave me middle school sleepover vibes."
"**RAVE** Now Solutions European Clay Powder and Red Moroccan Clay Powder. They're bloody pore vacuumers, much better than Glamglow imo. It sucks and tightens so hard as it dries that your face will temporarily be red after the mask. I like mixing mine with a little water, matcha powder and a couple drops of squalane oil for smoothness. It's really nice with Stridex. **New purchase:** Repurchased some more Stridex, it's the only BHA that works for me. Shame it's so drying. I also bought some 15% mandelic acid that I'll use once per week. Stoked for that one."
"**Short answer: Yes, a Gibson Les Paul can be used in virtually any genre** from Zakk Wylde's screeching heavy metal with Ozzy Osbourne to Les Paul's 1950s clean jazz. In fact, both Jimmy Page and [Santana have used Gibson Les Pauls](http://www.decoration-dolls.com/downloads/DCSANTANALP1974.JPG) as part of their signature sound, although Santana largely uses PRS and Strats nowadays and Jimmy Page is also known for recording a lot with a Fender Tele. Jimmy Page even has the rare distinction of being one of Gibson's ""double endorsers"" with [his own signature model Jimmy Page Les Paul.](http://www.musiciansfriend.com/guitars/gibson-custom-jimmy-page-signature-model-les-paul) **Caveat**: I do, though, encourage you NOT to buy a guitar like this as a surprise unless you are CERTAIN that he is not a ""gear-head"" *OR* you happen to know or can sneakily find out what SPECIFIC model of Gibson Les Paul he's been drooling over. **Most guitarists have the view that personal preference plays a MAJOR factor in the choice of a guitar,** even if you already have it narrowed down to the seemingly specific ""Gibson Les Paul."" Gibson makes nearly *200* different models of Les Pauls with different pickups and pickup configurations, tone woods, neck profiles, electronics, etc, ranging in price from under $1000 to ten times that. If you want to surprise your dad with a gift guitar, and he is already a guitar player, I highly encourage you to just tell him you want to buy him a guitar as a present, and talk to him about the specific details of what his preferences are within that, so you can choose one together that fits his preferences and your budget. ------- Long answer: I'm coming at this from a session player perspective. If your dad does a lot of gigging his mileage may vary. ***The amp matters a lot more than the guitar,*** but THAT SAID, you need the right guitar to match the MIX (if not necessarily the genre). First a little history... Electric solidbodies were originally designed for country and certain types of jazz. The first Spanish-style solidbodies (as opposed to lap steels, used in country music) were invented by a Jamaican jazz guitarist and inventor named Hedley Jones [\(10-min YouTube interview here\).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYz1MqeGH_c) Merle Travis, a country guitarist, also designed an electric solidbody around the same time, which was a heavy influence on Leo Fender's early prototypes for the Broadcaster and Esquire, precursors to the better-known Telecaster a couple of years later. Turning to Gibson: Les Pauls were actually not originally designed by the jazz guitarist Les Paul, to be used for jazz. In the 1940s, Les Paul originally designed a guitar called ""The Log,"" using an old Epiphone Broadway archtop jazzbox he owned that he had sawed in half, inserted a block of solid pine in the middle, and mounted pickups to that, then bracketed the hollowbody ""wings"" to the pine like so: [Les Paul's one-of-a-kind ""The Log""](http://www.les-paul.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Ch-1-Log.png) Les Paul wanted to commercialize this concept, but Gibson laughed at the idea when he approached them about it, calling it a ""broomstick with pickups."" A decade later, in 1951, seeing the initial success of Leo Fender's solidbodies in the country music market, Gibson approached Les Paul about endorsing a solidbody design based they'd come up with, based on the general shape and features of their archtop guitars. [Source.](http://www.les-paul.com/timeline/red-hot-red/) He chose some features, and they put his name on it. But don't think the LP was really popular among jazz players; it really wasn't and wasn't marketed that way. According to a 1957 letter from Gibson's Chief Engineer Walter Fuller to a prospective customer seeking advice on which Gibson guitar to buy:  [Source.](https://reverb.com/news/gallery-1950s-letters-with-gibson-concerning-one-doctors-electric-guitar-purchase) Les Pauls were actually not terribly popular in the 1950s. [If you look at this scan of a complete Gibson 1960 guitar and amp catalog](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/4szzvz/discussion_check_out_this_scan_of_a_gibson/?st=jbsa4bk8&amp;sh=10e69ec5), it is mostly aimed at jazz players, even the solidbody guitars - and this was in 1960, don't forget. Rock music hadn't really taken off as the premier mainstream style yet, and wouldn't really until The Beatles played on the Ed Sullivan Show in 1964. In fact, one of the main reasons the famed 1958 Gibson Les Paul burst is worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to collectors today is that it was considered a ""production failure"" in 1958, selling only 1712 units total (!) between 1958 and 1960. [Source.](http://www.vintageguitar.com/1865/gibson-1958-60-les-paul-standard-2/) The major advantage of a solid-body‚Äîbeing able to withstand high stage volume without feedback‚Äîwasn't really as big of an issue in the early 1950s as it was 15 years later, as PA systems technology started to become a field of its own, mostly because of bigger touring acts like The Beatles, The Grateful Dead, etc, and the introduction of the concept of (electrified) arena concerts. Les Pauls became popular for rock music when a handful of British and American electric blues-rock players such as Jimmy Page, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Peter Frampton, Mike Bloomfield, and others started using them in the 1960s. During the '70s and '80s, they also became popular with heavier rock guitarists such as Ace Frehley of KISS, Neal Schon of Journey, Alex Lifeson of Rush, and *so* many others. I said above that two things: The amp matters more than the guitar, and you have to match your guitar to the mix. Generally speaking, if you are playing funk or country or certain types of Texas blues, you're going to want a guitar with single-coil pickups (i.e. probably not a Les Paul). Getting a little technical here: Single-coil pickups tend to sound brighter because dual-coil (aka humbucking) pickups, used in most Les Pauls, have higher inductance, which lowers the resonant peak of the signal and gives the guitar a warmer tone when plugged in. Also, the larger 3D area of the magnetic field around the metal strings cancels some higher harmonics. If you want a really bright, cutting tone for country playing, you probably want a Telecaster or something similar. But, it does depend greatly on the mix. It's important to get your tone to a point that you're happy with it solo'ed, but in a mix is where it really matters, and you gotta be prepared to tweak or even re-amp etc if it's not working in a mix. For example, what cuts through in a mix often sounds harsh and brittle solo'ed. For people who play live a lot: Les Pauls *can* be a bad choice for a couple of reasons‚Äî 1. They tend to be heavy, which can wear on your neck, shoulders, and back after a set or two, if you play standing up. There are weight-relieved Les Paul models available to address this. 2. They have an absurd 17-degree headstock angle with very little wood on the 1-piece mahogany neck keeping them stable [\(cross section here\).](https://i.imgur.com/KhztZ73.jpg), making them [prone to breakage‚Äîhere's my old '98 Les Paul Standard DC.](https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3238/3141750765_acc4024c62_o.jpg) 3. They tend to be expensive, and the classic brown Gibson case with the gold stenciled logo can be quite tempting to thieves. As a side note, Gibsons are REALLY overpriced these days, and the quality has gone down a lot in recent years. I mean, absurdly so. I would not recommend a Gibson to anyone unless it's used and at least 20 years old. There are SUCH better deals on similar instruments from a dozen other brands, such as PRS, Carvin/Kiesel, Ibanez, and Heritage. If you are a set on a Gibson Les Paul, I strongly encourage you to buy a used one or consider a Heritage, which in my opinion is actually more true to Gibson's Golden Age than Gibson itself: When Gibson relocated from Kalamazoo, Michigan to Tennessee in 1984, a number of their factory workers did not want to relocate, and came together to buy the old Gibson factory where they'd worked all their lives from Gibson. They founded their own guitar company, Heritage, and just continued making instruments, using the exact same lumber suppliers, machinery, artisans, etc as before, with nearly identical designs. Basically, a Heritage is what a Gibson *should* be, before all the cost-cutting bullshit and pressure from stock market investors that took hold of Gibson the last few years. Also, they are cheaper than Gibsons. I hope this helps!"
"**Skin Tint:** I've been using this stuff since it launched - 3 different formulas! The latest one has a little more coverage than people typically whine about, but still less than MAC F&amp;B. I used to really love the Skin Tint, but I've stopped using it lately due to longevity issues. The finish it gives your face upon application is beautiful (very blurring/brightening, almost like a super subtle filter), but IMO disappears within 2-4 hours, which is honestly pretty tragic. **Stretch Concealer:** Personally, I don't love these for undereyes. The dewy formula means they're quite prone to creasing. Additionally, the shade range runs a bit more yellow, whereas I think peach is better for the undereyes. I do enjoy this as a face concealer - it's extremely comfy and sinks into the skin like... well, skin. However, longevity is also extremely poor - maybe 2-4 hours with a setting powder? I end up having to reapply/repowder throughout the day. I use it on my no-makeup days when it's easy to do those things. **Skincare Set:** I personally don't love the Priming Moisturizer, but then I'm dry-skinned. Embryolisse (the inspo for it) is simply better, IMO. The Jelly Cleanser is HG status for me, but I don't wear much eye makeup and my makeup tends to be light, generally. It's sufficient if you wear Glossier levels of makeup, but not if you like to layer on the eyeliner and mascara and red lipstick. However, I think the formula is just beautiful and leaves the skin so soft and plump afterward. As for the Balm Dot Coms, I personally really like them and have them lying about everywhere. Some people say they're overpriced Vaseline, but I respectfully disagree - they're much more occlusive. They're not the most actually hydrating balms in the world, but there are *some* hydrating ingredients in there, at least, compared to just petroleum/petrolatum. Basically, I like them more than I think they're actually good. **Cloud Paints:** You already loved Beam, so I'm confident you'll also enjoy Puff and Dusk. Easy to see why these are hero products. My chief complaint is the packaging - I'd love a more funneled tip since the current one is hard to control."
"**Stampede** - In the middle of a lesson we'd all suddenly start stamping our feet on the floor and someone would say ""there's a stampede on the horizon."" Then, we'd increase the speed of stamping, and say ""it's getting closer!"" and then suddenly stop. Everyone would look around in confusion and someone would ask ""was that you sir/miss?"" **Humming** - We used to have this art teacher who was so boring and rude. Her lessons were the worst. We'd had enough of her drawing on our work in red pen so we decided to all start humming during her lessons. It was just this monotone buzz noise, everyone in the class did it, even the quiet good kids. She'd get so mad, saying ""whoever it is, stop, because I know who it is doing it."" Nah, she had no clue. **She never did thing** - There's this English teacher at our school who it seemed like was forever reading us these short stories she'd wrote. It seemed that she always managed to include some variant on ""Person did thing. Person NEVER did thing."" So whenever we saw her do anything we would /always/ say in a dramatic voice, ""Miss K sat down. She never sat down."" ""Miss K taught English. She never taught English."" Our class were/are really weird. We also had a phase where everyone was obsessed with Rubik's cubes and finger puppets."

"**WARNING! LONG POST AHEAD!** Hallo! Hopefully you don't mind a long read, I tend to be pretty wordy when explaining things! I've been roleplaying for seven or so years now. I work in a wide variety of topics; apocalypse and sci-fi are general favorites however I'll happily take up a topic that's interesting. A few on the details about me: * 21 years old and fine with romance/NSFW when it's a good addition to the plot. * EST Time zone- I'm happy to play with someone from any zone, though! * I basically work full time, however I'm off by 4pm EST nine times outta ten when I am working. * If I'm working, I might be able to get a short reply in. Or a long one, if the manager is nice and it's slow. * Preference for long-term roleplay. * Loves to read. Please, write me novels. * Third person, past tense. The usual here! * I'm pretty good about grammar but typos do like to slip out. (I also intermix variations, like color and behaviour) * Lots of characters- I prefer female roles (naturally) but I have males as well. * Likes to throw said characters under buses or drag over cacti. Expect angst. * I'll roleplay most things that aren't ponies. General furry stuff I'm not too interested in. * I like to draw so I may draw things * Telegram and Discord are both fine for me! * Okay with cursing, I don't swear myself that much, though. * I'll tell about the *saucy* preferences in chat! * I'll reply to you ASAP- I might be at work or asleep, so don't fret! On free days I certainly can rapid fire.  As for a partner, I'm looking for anyone that's at least 20 years old. Romance typically happens in roleplays with me; smut as well when it's fitting. I'd like for someone to have a passion for writing, since I love to get a long response to sit and read. Willing to work with me to create something fun for both of us, as well. I'd like a long term story, but shorter I can be too. Just, please, tell me if you're not feeling like roleplaying. I'm sure we all could tell how we're upset someone we were excited to RP with flaked and blocked us with no explanation.  To give an idea of myself, a few of my personal favorite characters with some details (here's the most of the length! XD). If no characters here interest, still talk! I have a whole lot more, these are just a couple of picks. _______________________________________________________________________ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ **Cara Sckell** Cara was always easy to spot with her towering height, topping at 7'4"". If that wasn't enough she had red-orange hair that seemed almost fiery in daylight, with curls to match wild personality. To a fault she is hardheaded and will dive into plenty of dangerous situations, which has gotten hairy but her wild drive is insatiable. However even with her menacing form and a gaze that could burn through a skull, Cara is rather friendly and sociable till someone ticks her off. This was well known in her working years of service in the Marines, earning her the nickname 'Spinosaur' or simply Spino. Now discharged because of having shattered a femur and an improper healing that left her with a limp, she is hardheaded to get up to some kind of work. Usually I play her 28 (when she was honorably discharged) to 30, but I can go into when she is younger and actively in the military.  I do have some background work with Cara, among that is how she came to have a bad leg; which was an attempt at torture when she'd been captured. The resulting botched healing is what got her discharged. She has quite haunting scars on her thigh and underlying bone from the whole ordeal. She became leader of a Special Forces team, not unlike the Nave SEALS, called the Dino Squad- hence her Spino nickname leading to the whole name of the group.      **Cale Judas**  Cale is more reserved and laid back. He's incredibly oblivious to just about anything, so he's pretty apt to totally miss that he might be intimidating or making someone uncomfortable. Though Cale is a bit standoffish he doesn't mean any ill will to anyone that hasn't done wrong. Such as he'll haul someone that's hurt over his shoulder and cart them to somewhere safe before he really figures out the person probably has the daylights scared out of them. Cale tops at 6'3"", and more of a wide and bulky build. With a beard he could be considered a barbarian; well toned, heavily muscled, yet has a belly. I have next to never played with Cale so I don't have a whole lot worked out with him just yet, so opportunities to do so would be great. I do know though I want him to be more a 'machine' if you will, until he gets sense knocked into him that hey there's a thing called emotions.   **Sapphirus Byron** Another Marine, but a long-standing one. Usually played in a sci-fi future setting, Sapphirus is renowned as a top melee fighter; her armor while sorely outdated still stands the rigors of battle- due to tinkering that may or may not be legal. Under the name 'Mockingjay"" or J47, she works in her own ship to whatever they call her to. Her ship, the Raven, is a tiny vessel that's meant to bash and crash though the hull of anything it hits into- a rugged and starry-painted ship that's quite the nuisance when it punches through a hull in a vacuum. Saph herself; she had some mental troubles that lead to vivid flashbacks where she may lash at her own crew. She hates the medical ward- will avoid if she can still crawl. Usually it's best to knock her out if you want to do more than bandages. Never seen out of her armor by the public or even most servicemen, her true identity is a mystery, other than dark hair, blue eyes, and many tattoos along numerous scars under dented and tested armor.  **Tylka Byron** Daughter of Sapphirus, she's more well known for being rather... funny, since she's got an odd behaviour. She was popular, of course, for being child of a legend like Sapphirus, though didn't have the same drive to fight. Rather, she is a mechanic who likes to get into out of the way spots and fix issues around equipment. However how she fixes these is a power of its own; a result of her father having a mechanical interface to himself, and it passed to her in an organic mechanic. Such lets her bend and mold matter to her will, need only touch it or a connecting surface to change it, drawing upon the energy around her to do it. This is a controversial thing that only higher-ups in the military know all the details about. She can also change herself, usually in the form of wings. (She's very open to the idea that some outside organization is after her to figure out how she bends matter at will.)  **Saffron ""Sharktooth"" Knapp** This girl is a ship Captain, and a rough-and-tumble one that commands the Undertow with a Parabolan Panther as mascot. This is out of the game Sunless Sea, but is easily adaptable to the general seafaring plot. Pale skin contrasts dark hair; she longs to see the sunlight. Still tall, but not too much at 5'11"" - enough that her heavy frame provides power to haul carts of good on an off dock. Called Sharktooth due to having her teeth sharpened, she will only fight if she needs to- and will come to arms tooth and nail when called upon. Protective of her crew, she will do her damnedest to make sure they get out alive on a floating ship. She sails on trade routes, working for the Admiralty, and other personal business. Easygoing and simple to get along with; an occasional drink or two and some gambling may be had in the galley of her ship here and there- they are a family, after all, sailing the wide, dark Unterzee.  **Ellie ""Winged"" Knapp** Daughter of Saffron, she's played where a darker theme is wanted as Ellaine, unlike her mother, deals in shady business as much as she does with the Admiralty on her own ship she commands with a kitten of her mother's panther. Shorter at 5'6"" and a small-medium build, she doesn't look it but can throw a mean punch; she is known appear in bar brawl events, and to shut down rogue fights. Tenacious as her mother, however much more bitey as she loses temper a lot faster. Ellie has a dream of flight, and has made several mechanical drawings that decorate the walls of her office, thus a nickname of 'Winged'. However as good looking, she never got her contraptions to work. A very good pair for someone that works in mechanics, if they can deal with her that is. Also very well adaptable to a general seafaring.  **Eve Willow** A general gal that can be tailored to most plots. Eve is rather mute, not really talking though she does make other vocalizations. While not that strong, she has a preference for natural things, making her good with animals and farming. A calmness great enough that grants her ability to be rather frustrating, though with that comes a slow but meticulous mind- presented with a problem she can pick her way through it, however telling other people the solution is where the problem lies. She does speak though, to chosen few. Although if one was to play something that she recognizes, and she's comfortable at the moment with those around her, she will join in with a rather shockingly clear and pure voice, for someone who never speaks.  **Xander Horus** Xander is an alien that was put onto Earth to learn and eventually find out how to make actual contact a bit more easy, after his kind has seen extreme retaliation of humans against things that are 'monsters' and their movies about invasions. To keep up his image, he is in college, and was trained in shapeshifting, and he's decent at it though not perfect. He passes as a human, though never will take off his shirt in public (lest he give himself away) or wear anything above the knees for that reason because he can only change extremities at the time. He's very much into botany, the little house he acquired is full of plants along with a large fish tank. For him being a monster, he's pretty afraid of them and wouldn't be caught dead in the dark without some form of light. His true form is massive, just under ten feet with black skin and red markings, eyeless but brows and a crest to convey expressions. To this day he can't explain how vision works in the natural form. He keeps that the first few transitions from natural vision to eyes were startling because they were really sensitive to light. (Try to make him embarrassed for flustered when it's only our two characters. Go for the neck! *mileage may vary)  **Jessa Nero**  Jessa is flexible in her role; whether it's a bandit, a lone survivor/drifter, maybe even assassin, Jessa certainly is a character that's ripe for most anything. Jessa is a tiny little thing, small and wiry. She makes up for it in both bark and bite though; despite her small stature, she can throw a mean punch. She's a whole lot more mouthy and my-way-or-highway type, though she'll follow someone if you can convince her. She's still got a soft side though, once you get close enough that is. Jessa has a tendency to get a little more sexual in her talks than any other of my characters, so she can be a bit interesting. Though she's got a pretty bad fault- Jessa hides wounds, and is good at it. Whatever the cause, she'll do her best to patch it up and then try to just walk it off, avoiding a trip to the doctor. You'll probably have to wrestle her down if you want to get at it. Or slip a sedative. Whichever works, really."
"**WARNING! LONG POST AHEAD!** Hallo! Hopefully you don't mind a long read, I tend to be pretty wordy when explaining things! I've been roleplaying for seven or so years now. I work in a wide variety of topics; apocalypse and sci-fi are general favorites however I'll happily take up a topic that's interesting. A few on the details about me: * 21 years old and fine with romance/NSFW when it's a good addition to the plot. * I do work- I may not reply all the time, but I try! * EST Time zone- I'm happy to play with someone from any time, though! * Preference for long-term roleplay. * Third person, past tense. The usual here! * I'm pretty good about grammar but typos do like to slip out. (I also intermix variations, like color and behaviour) * Lots of characters- I prefer female roles (naturally) but I have males as well. * Likes to throw said characters under buses or drag over cacti. Expect angst. * I'll roleplay most things that aren't ponies. Furries are to a degree; while I am, I find it difficult to do anymore. * I like to draw so I may draw things * Telegram and Discord are both fine for me! * Okay with cursing, I don't swear myself that much, though.  As for a partner, I'm looking for anyone that's at least 20 years old. Romance typically happens in roleplays with me; smut as well when it's fitting. I'd like for someone to have a passion for writing, since I love to get a long response to sit and read. Willing to work with me to create something fun for both of us, as well. I'd like a long term story, but shorter I can be too. Just, please, tell me if you're not feeling like roleplaying. I'm sure we all could tell how we're upset someone we were excited to RP with flaked and blocked us with no explanation.  To give an idea of myself, a few of my personal favorite characters with some details (here's the most of the length! XD). If no characters or plots here interest, still talk! I'm always up to making new ones or using some of my many more characters. I have an orca mermaid I would like to use again, for example. _______________________________________________________________________ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ **Cara Sckell** Cara was always easy to spot with her towering height, topping just over seven feet. If that wasn't enough she had red-orange hair that seemed almost fiery in daylight, with curls to match wild personality. To a fault she is hardheaded and will dive into plenty of dangerous situations, which has gotten hairy but her wild drive is insatiable. However even with her menacing form and a gaze that could burn through a skull, Cara is rather friendly and sociable till someone ticks her off. This was well known in her working years of service in the Marines, earning her the nickname 'Spinosaur' or simply Spino. Now discharged because of having shattered a femur and an improper healing that left her with a limp, she is hardheaded to get up to some kind of work. Usually I play her 28 (when she was honorably discharged) to 30, but I can go into when she is younger and actively in the military.       **Sapphirus Byron** Another Marine, but a long-standing one. Usually played in a sci-fi future setting, Sapphirus is renowned as a top melee fighter; her armor while sorely outdated still stands the rigors of battle- due to tinkering that may or may not be legal.

Albinism makes her stick out, and while scars are on her skin, they are pale grey and hard to pick out. She's another mute gal, tiny and frail. She prefers to avoid people if she can, living in a shack in the woods, cooking for herself of game that she takes great care to prepare and make the most of and using the rest in gardens or feed for other animals. Yukki generally will flee from intruders at first sight, even if it means leaving her home. However while she's pretty defenseless, when she becomes emotionally overwhelmed she will transform herself into a beast that's best described as a cross between bear and pangolin. In that form she loses herself, becoming vicious and aggressive. It's very dangerous for anyone to be nearby until she calms down."

And a bit outlandish; there's more than I'm writing too. I would love to work with Cara in this form again!) >Cara, unlike her current form, started in a world where the beasts of the ancient past ran amok. In this same time, an alien presence was trying to take the world for their own. They cut off the water from the humans and dinosaurs in hopes for them to eventually die out. The dinos were genetic mutants, born from test tubes that'd also been mixed with human genes along with many more, a major contributing factor of their breakout. It started with her mother however; being forcibly bred by an alpha male Spino after it'd killed the blind Spinosaur that guarded her. She later escapes the male to a settlement where she would give birth, sharing no details of the true father. At this time, it seems the aliens have gone as nobody has seen anything of them. >Cara grows up much stronger and wittier than others of her level. She has no patience for suitors and will break a man's jaw before telling them to go away. She often hunts and gathers water, where she eventually befriends a small raptor. Suddenly the incessant clicking she makes is clear; she can speak their language (in a way, at least). At one point she almost drowns, and finds out another part of her father's genetics- subconsciously, she can edit and evolve her genetic code at will. However once this is discovered it comes at a cost- both a heavy physical toll later. Also she ~~probably will~~ may lapse into the hyper aggressiveness in overwhelming moments.   **Sapphirus Byron** Another Marine, but a long-standing one.

Although if one was to play something that she recognizes, and she's comfortable at the moment with those around her, she will join in with a rather shockingly clear and pure voice, for someone who never speaks.  **Xander Horus** Xander is an alien that was put onto Earth to learn and eventually find out how to make actual contact a bit more easy, after his kind has seen extreme retaliation of humans against things that are 'monsters' and their movies about invasions. To keep up his image, he is in college, and was trained in shapeshifting, and he's decent at it though not perfect. He passes as a human, though never will take off his shirt in public (lest he give himself away) or wear anything above the knees for that reason because he can only change extremities at the time. He's very much into botany, the little house he acquired is full of plants along with a large fish tank. For him being a monster, he's pretty afraid of them and wouldn't be caught dead in the dark without some form of light. His true form is massive, just under ten feet with black skin and red markings, eyeless but brows and a crest to convey expressions. To this day he can't explain how vision works in the natural form. He keeps that the first few transitions from natural vision to eyes were startling because they were really sensitive to light. (Try to make him embarrassed for flustered when it's only our two characters. Go for the neck! *mileage may vary)  **Yukki Onnah** Yukki is a being of pure energy; having no true form but she takes that of a human and a pangolin. Albinism makes her stick out, and while scars are on her skin, they are pale grey and hard to pick out. She's another mute gal, tiny and frail. She prefers to avoid people if she can, living in a shack in the woods, cooking for herself of game that she takes great care to prepare and make the most of and using the rest in gardens or feed for other animals. Yukki generally will flee from intruders at first sight, even if it means leaving her home. However while she's pretty defenseless, when she becomes emotionally overwhelmed she will transform herself into a beast that's best described as a cross between bear and pangolin. In that form she loses herself, becoming vicious and aggressive. It's very dangerous for anyone to be nearby until she calms down."
"**WARNING! LONG POST AHEAD!** Hallo! Hopefully you don't mind a long read, I tend to be pretty wordy when explaining things! I've been roleplaying for seven or so years now. I work in a wide variety of topics; apocalypse and sci-fi are general favorites however I'll happily take up a topic that's interesting. A few on the details about me: * 21 years old and fine with romance/NSFW when it's a good addition to the plot. * I work 30+ hours on an unpredictable schedule, but I might be able to pop in while on the clock here and there. * EST Time zone- I'm happy to play with someone from any zone, though! * Preference for long-term roleplay. * Loves to read. Please, write me novels. * Third person, past tense. The usual here! * I'm pretty good about grammar but typos do like to slip out. (I also intermix variations, like color and behaviour) * Lots of characters- I prefer female roles (naturally) but I have males as well. * Likes to throw said characters under buses or drag over cacti. Expect angst. * I'll roleplay most things that aren't ponies. General furry stuff I'm not too interested in. * I like to draw so I may draw things * Telegram and Discord are both fine for me! * Okay with cursing, I don't swear myself that much, though. * I'll tell about the *saucy* preferences in chat! * I'll reply to you ASAP- I might be at work or asleep, so don't fret!  As for a partner, I'm looking for anyone that's at least 20 years old. Romance typically happens in roleplays with me; smut as well when it's fitting. I'd like for someone to have a passion for writing, since I love to get a long response to sit and read. Willing to work with me to create something fun for both of us, as well. I'd like a long term story, but shorter I can be too. Just, please, tell me if you're not feeling like roleplaying. I'm sure we all could tell how we're upset someone we were excited to RP with flaked and blocked us with no explanation.  To give an idea of myself, a few of my personal favorite characters with some details (here's the most of the length! XD). If no characters here interest, still talk! I'm always up to making new ones when the situation calls or using some of my many more characters. I have an orca mermaid I would like to use again, for example. _______________________________________________________________________ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ **Cara Sckell** Cara was always easy to spot with her towering height, topping just over seven feet. If that wasn't enough she had red-orange hair that seemed almost fiery in daylight, with curls to match wild personality. To a fault she is hardheaded and will dive into plenty of dangerous situations, which has gotten hairy but her wild drive is insatiable. However even with her menacing form and a gaze that could burn through a skull, Cara is rather friendly and sociable till someone ticks her off. This was well known in her working years of service in the Marines, earning her the nickname 'Spinosaur' or simply Spino. Now discharged because of having shattered a femur and an improper healing that left her with a limp, she is hardheaded to get up to some kind of work. Usually I play her 28 (when she was honorably discharged) to 30, but I can go into when she is younger and actively in the military.  I do have some background work with Cara, among that is how she came to have a bad leg; which was an attempt at torture when she'd been captured. The resulting botched healing is what got her discharged. She has quite haunting scars on her thigh and underlying bone from the whole ordeal. She became leader of a Special Forces team, not unlike the Nave SEALS, called the Dino Squad- hence her Spino nickname leading to the whole name of the group.       **Sapphirus Byron** Another Marine, but a long-standing one. Usually played in a sci-fi future setting, Sapphirus is renowned as a top melee fighter; her armor while sorely outdated still stands the rigors of battle- due to tinkering that may or may not be legal. Under the name 'Mockingjay"" or J47, she works in her own ship to whatever they call her to. Her ship, the Raven, is a tiny vessel that's meant to bash and crash though the hull of anything it hits into- a rugged and starry-painted ship that's quite the nuisance when it punches through a hull in a vacuum. Saph herself; she had some mental troubles that lead to vivid flashbacks where she may lash at her own crew. She hates the medical ward- will avoid if she can still crawl. Usually it's best to knock her out if you want to do more than bandages. Never seen out of her armor by the public or even most servicemen, her true identity is a mystery, other than dark hair, blue eyes, and many tattoos along numerous scars under dented and tested armor.  **Tylka Byron** Daughter of Sapphirus, she's more well known for being rather... funny, since she's got an odd behaviour. She was popular, of course, for being child of a legend like Sapphirus, though didn't have the same drive to fight. Rather, she is a mechanic who likes to get into out of the way spots and fix issues around equipment. However how she fixes these is a power of its own; a result of her father having a mechanical interface to himself, and it passed to her in an organic mechanic. Such lets her bend and mold matter to her will, need only touch it or a connecting surface to change it, drawing upon the energy around her to do it. This is a controversial thing that only higher-ups in the military know all the details about. She can also change herself, usually in the form of wings. (She's very open to the idea that some outside organization is after her to figure out how she bends matter at will.)  **Saffron ""Sharktooth"" Knapp** This girl is a ship Captain, and a rough-and-tumble one that commands the Undertow with a Parabolan Panther as mascot. This is out of the game Sunless Sea, but is easily adaptable to the general seafaring plot. Pale skin contrasts dark hair; she longs to see the sunlight. Still tall, but not too much at 5'11"" - enough that her heavy frame provides power to haul carts of good on an off dock. Called Sharktooth due to having her teeth sharpened, she will only fight if she needs to- and will come to arms tooth and nail when called upon. Protective of her crew, she will do her damnedest to make sure they get out alive on a floating ship. She sails on trade routes, working for the Admiralty, and other personal business. Easygoing and simple to get along with; an occasional drink or two and some gambling may be had in the galley of her ship here and there- they are a family, after all, sailing the wide, dark Unterzee.  **Ellie ""Winged"" Knapp** Daughter of Saffron, she's played where a darker theme is wanted as Ellaine, unlike her mother, deals in shady business as much as she does with the Admiralty on her own ship she commands with a kitten of her mother's panther. Shorter at 5'6"" and a small-medium build, she doesn't look it but can throw a mean punch; she is known appear in bar brawl events, and to shut down rogue fights. Tenacious as her mother, however much more bitey as she loses temper a lot faster. Ellie has a dream of flight, and has made several mechanical drawings that decorate the walls of her office, thus a nickname of 'Winged'. However as good looking, she never got her contraptions to work. A very good pair for someone that works in mechanics, if they can deal with her that is. Also very well adaptable to a general seafaring; in that case mascot would be a large (probably predatory) bird.  **Eve Willow** A general gal that can be tailored to most plots. Eve is rather mute, not really talking though she does make other vocalizations. While not that strong, she has a preference for natural things, making her good with animals and farming. A calmness great enough that grants her ability to be rather frustrating, though with that comes a slow but meticulous mind- presented with a problem she can pick her way through it, however telling other people the solution is where the problem lies. She does speak though, to chosen few. Although if one was to play something that she recognizes, and she's comfortable at the moment with those around her, she will join in with a rather shockingly clear and pure voice, for someone who never speaks.  **Xander Horus** Xander is an alien that was put onto Earth to learn and eventually find out how to make actual contact a bit more easy, after his kind has seen extreme retaliation of humans against things that are 'monsters' and their movies about invasions.

In that form she loses herself, becoming vicious and aggressive. It's very dangerous for anyone to be nearby until she calms down.  **Kol** Kol in an immortal being that appears to be in late 20's to early 30's. She is part of eleven siblings that 'created' the world in a way; working either on their own or alongside a god (whichever works) to create the planet as they do others. Each imbued their own strength into the soils and the creatures; though Kol was a bit different. As her other siblings created the life, gave them will and habits of all kinds, Kol was the eventual end that would take them once their bodies ran out of time, escorting them to their places in the afterlife she creates. Of course this spurred anger among the siblings since she takes away the creations of the rest. Thinking without Death their world would be perfect, Kol was banished for the heavens to walk the earth. Kol became fearful of humans for they fear the inky black wings she possesses; and flees at any sign of attack or even just ill glances. While ageless and undying, she can be killed, however it is not permanent. Kol also still feels pain, as her form of rapid healing makes it impossible for her to go numb; and although she heals her body still retains scars. Kol is especially skiddish around humans, since she is often hunted when words gets out that the 'Angel of Death' is around. She's not hard to corner if she gets grounded by a broken wing or whatever, though.  **Jessa Nero** Jessa is flexible in her role; whether it's a bandit, a lone survivor/drifter, maybe even assassin, Jessa certainly is a character that's ripe for most anything. Jessa is a tiny little thing, small and wiry. She makes up for it in both bark and bite though; despite her small stature, she can throw a mean punch. She's a whole lot more mouthy and my-way-or-highway type, though she'll follow someone if you can convince her. She's still got a soft side though, once you get close enough that is. Jessa has a tendency to get a little more sexual in her talks than any other of my characters, so she can be a bit interesting. Though she's got a pretty bad fault- Jessa hides wounds, and is good at it. Whatever the cause, she'll do her best to patch it up and then try to just walk it off, avoiding a trip to the doctor. You'll probably have to wrestle her down if you want to get at it. Or slip a sedative. Whichever works, really."

"**What are you currently using? How many foundations do you have and why?** I'm using 3 different things right now - Boscia Light bb, MUFE Water Blend in Y215, and Missha Perfect Cover in no 13. I prefer sheer or light coverage, I just happened to try these at different times. **What other products have you used?** A few from the drugstore.. ELF Flawless Finish liquid, Rimmel Stay Matte liquid mousse, Hard Candy Glamouflage, L'oreal Infallible (16hr, it had a red pump, not the newer Infallible product line).. Avon Extra Lasting.. MUFE Ultra HD. I think that's about all of them. **How do you like what you're currently using? Is anything a holy grail?** The Boscia is almost done and I love it, but the colour range sucks. I'll probably repurchase the other two. MUFE makes me feel more fancy and I'll wear it when I have time to get ready, whereas the Missha or Boscia is for early work mornings or when I don't really care much if I look perfect. **What's your greatest requirement in a foundation?** Sheer-medium coverage, dewy, good shade range. I HATE heavy or full coverage or matte and drying foundations. I don't mind and sometimes even prefer if they have micro-shimmer/glitter in the foundation. **How easy is it for you to find foundation that works?** Fairly easy. I can usually pick the lightest or second lightest shade in the drugstore ranges and be OK; not perfect, but I can survive. Some ranges are just far too pink, though. I'm neutral-yellow.. I find that MUFE has the best shade range and naming system. **What tools do you use to apply? How do you set/finish it?** I apply everything on the back of my hand and then use a wet beauty blender to put it on my face and blend it out. I set everything with LunatiCK Cosmetic Labs' HD pressed powder. I usually use a stippling brush to go from hand to face for my MUFE Water Blend and then blend what's stippled on my face with a damp beauty blender. Otherwise, I find too much of that particular foundation gets lost/absorbed. **Do you wear primer? What's your primary objective in priming-longevity, luminosity, etc?** I like illuminating primers, like Lioele Blooming Shimmer Pearl Base or Becca Backlight Filter. **If you don't have a HG, what foundations are you interested in trying out in the future?** I tried a sample of Guerlain Lingerie de peau once. It was really fucking nice, but I don't like to spend over $50 on a foundation or BB. I also really want to try the Tarte Rainforest of the Sea."
"**What's your favorite weapon in your make up arsenal?** My KVD Shade+Light Eye Pallete! **What your least favorite?** Hmm.. Probably my Laura Geller Eye Spackle. I've been using it as a base because I don't have any matte eyeshadow bases, but it's pretty patchy and creases really bad :( **What is your go-to look like??** I like to stick with a neutral eyeshadow look and a dark red lip! It's easy to do and I can still look put together for work or school! **If you're sick, do you still decide to put on makeup?** Yes, because even when I'm sick I usually have to go to work or school :( But I only apply enough to make me look like I'm not dying, and nothing more haha  **What is a look you're working on trying?** I've been trying to wear colored eyeliner on my waterline more. I just bought a purple eyeliner and I love it!  **What is the most daring thing you've done, make up wise?** I'm not very daring with makeup, but I wore Colourpop's LAX (which is a super dark red) to work one day. It was out of my comfort zone but my coworkers liked it! **What's an item everyone should try??** Liquid lipsticks! I know they aren't for everyone, but they are definitely worth trying.  **If you had to choose, what item would you save from a house fire? (make wise, ofc! )** My KVD Shade+Light eye Pallete, Tartlette pallete, or my Becca Highlighter in Opal. Or my Colourpop Ultra Mattes. Oh man, do I have to just pick one?  **Do you have any pets? If so, what are they like?? If not, tell us about a pet you've met!** I have a 3 year old Maltese named Bentley! This isn't a very good picture, but its the most recent one I have of [him](http://imgur.com/g1HAMX3)  **What's your favorite snack?** Popcorn!  **Besides RAoM, what's your favorite sub??** /r/MakeupAddiction, /r/TalesFromRetail, or /r/CFB  **Socks in bed, or no?**  No! **What's your favorite book?** It changes all the time, but right now it's Delirium but Lauren Oliver  **What's currently on your playlist?** I'm really loving Anberlin right now, especially Foreign Language and A Day Late. I've also been listening to The 1975 in anticipation of their new album!  **What is your favorite movie??** How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days or Remember The Titans!"
"*Extremely.* He held very rigid views on gender roles. Women do and wear X. Men do and wear Y. He didn't feel one was being a woman ""properly"" if one didn't wear the tallest heels, the drag queeniest makeup, the most revealing clothing, as much pink and red and frills and bows as you can find, etc. I wasn't feminine enough for him, despite being too high maintenance girly for some other men. I don't really believe in gendered clothing or fashions, or behaviours. So him demanding that Women Behave This Way, and doing otherwise was an abomination, did not work for me."
"*I'm* not trying to be rude when I say this- but do yourself I gigantic favor and research domestic abuse and violence. Learn about the cycle of abuse, common timelines of abusive relationships, and frequently ignored warning signs. It's good stuff to know anyway, so you don't ever find yourself falling into a bad situation. Most relationships don't start out abusive- most of them start out great. There might be redflags- but ones that are only really red flags in retrospect (like, they could have just as easily been not a big deal). Maybe he's a bit jealous or maybe a bit protective or asks to look through your phone or talks shit about your friends once or twice or maybe he gets a little angrier than most people when someone contradicts him but otherwise he's great so you compromise because *you know that relationships require compromise*. Then one day it's a little bit worse- maybe he makes a bit of a scene because he saw some guy flirting with you and he blamed you in the moment but later he said he was sorry and you *know* he's a good guy so you forgive him. That's where the cycle comes into play. Episode -&gt; Big display of regret and sorrow -&gt; Period of calm -&gt; Episode. Maybe at first the periods of calm are so long that you forget about prior episodes. But over time the cycle shortens and the episodes get more and more severe but by then you're being gaslit and you've accepted this all as normal because it crept up on you- sort of like getting on the scale one day and realizing that you gained 15 pounds and didn't notice. You've gotten used to it, you've gotten good at coping. And probably by then it's hard to get out. You feel responsible, he's threatening to hurt himself if you leave, your finances are tied up, you have kids together, he's isolated you from your support network whatever. Marriage might make it more complicated but this happens outside of marriage too. These situations are complex."

"*Original E-mail*:  Almost a year ago I interviewed with you for the Marketing Internship at Wired.com. I know immediately after we met I sent you a thank you email, but those are so forced; even if it is sincere, why would the recipient believe you? They're getting one after each interview. This thank you email is sincere because it's in retrospect; meeting with you helped me out. That interview was the first legitimate meeting for a job I had ever been on; it was also the hardest. Personally, I think I crashed and burned, but you humored me and in the long run gave me insight on how to act, be prepared etc. The locker question: I still think I would have gotten the answer by myself but I was nervous, can you blame me? It was my first real interview and I was vying for the possibility to be able to work with one of my favorite publications; I have never sweat so much in my life. You explained the answer to me and showed me three different ways to solve - I wound up bumping into it at another interview a couple of months later and made myself come across as a genius; solving the problem in less than a minute. So, thanks again! **Response** Wow, what a great email. Thanks so much for reaching out and glad I had a positive influence on you. I saw your linked in request and recognized the name but couldn't quite pinpoint where I knew you from. For fun I just pulled your resume and interview sheet (yes, I keep them all). Ahh yes... 7 typos in the cover letter but everything else was so positive. And you got the red sox bonus question right. Knowing now that it was your first interview ever is understandable, and glad they were all downhill from there. My notes had that you were ambitious, organized (you labeled your breakfast!) and great to be around, but I felt you were a little under-dressed and you were the first person that ever asked ""would I have to clean anything?"" Hey, you never know until you ask. But again, so glad I could be of help and glad it worked out in the end. Take care, good luck in your career, and let me know if I can be of any help in the future. **I responded again** Thanks for reaching back to me same day, it's a breath of fresh air because I can imagine how busy you are. You'll be happy to know that since our interview I have since bought a suit and you are the first and last interviewer I asked about cleaning. **His Response and End of Correspondence** LOL. You'd have the last laugh if you saw the olive green double-breasted suit I wore to a job interview in the early 90s. *He's super down to earth and I really appreciated it. If you could have seen the look on my face when I sent my un-spell checked cover letter. I was screaming at the computer, I had not meant to press send because I knew it wasn't done.*"

"*When I was five, I would have this recurring dream...* **TLDR: The devil killed his new 5-year-old bride** I'm standing in the middle of my high school dance in a real pretty red dress. I'm moving my body side to side, making the sides of the dress *whoosh!* as if it's on fire. Suddenly, a big hole opens up in front of my feet, and the devil pills me through by my ankle. He has me tied up to the end of a helicopter. As he's flying the helicopter to this really big castle over a sea of fire, I'm screaming my head off in hopes that someone hears me. Nope. The last words spoken in this dream is always ""you'll be m pretty bride now, bitch!!"" Right before the devil cuts off the rope, making me fall into the pits of hell."

"+1 for **Nyon** especially because in the last 5 years they've put a lot of money in making it an interesting town (there's a lot going on for a little less than 20'000 people!).

I'm going to have to go up to St. Cergue with the red train to go to Rando Burger won't I?) **Ponte Brolla** is underrated in the sense that it used to be really cool and now it's forgotten. Same with **[Orselina](https://www.ticino.ch/en/commons/details/Sacred-Mount-Madonna-del-Sasso/2693.html)**. For me generally: **Aargau**/**Zug**. It's REALLY PRETTY for distance hiking. I've surprised 4 people on different occasions by forcing them to go on hikes with me to ""the flachland"". It gets overseen because Glarus is so close but it's low-key, no hassle, walk wherever. Also I've only recently been to **Bremgarten** and it's so pretty!"

"....what? lol, I'm not a virgin, and certainly never said or implied that I was. The term ""red flag"" doesn't mean ""something is wrong with the person"" - it's a term that comes from racing. A red flag on the racing course literally means the race stops, and that's how people are using it. A guy being a virgin is a red flag to me, which means *that it's something that will make me stop pursuing him*. Smoking, kids, divorce - all those are red flags to me, as well as the guy being a virgin.  I am saying comments like MINE get downvoted on Reddit. Because there are so many older virgins who seem to think it's fine for them to have dealbreakers, but dealbreakers involving them are super unreasonable."
"/r/MAKEUPADDICTION Like, seriously seriously. Those ladies know what they. are. talking. about. And if they don't they can point you at a blogger who does or a youtuber or some shit.

Use their search bar like it's your own personal make up guru. edit: My fave lipstick right now is Clinique's Different Lipstick in Spiced Apple, it's an awesome warm brick red that makes my eyes look super blue and my skin look so creamy.

"1) Are the kids getting SS death benefits? That will help in the cost of raising/taking care of them. 2) You mention that you pay most of the bills. You *can* do it on your own. You might need to downsize or cut out other things, but you absolutely can make it work. 3) Go to a divorce attorney right now. As if it wasn't a big enough red flag that he told the 15 year old that his parents would've beat him, he's been using these children as an excuse to make you his personal sex slave. You finally said no, and he threatened to leave, belittled, and abused you. You need to get out. Even if everything was 100% hunky dory up to now, there are some things you never come back from. My husband and I have the same age gap that you and your husband do (I'm a couple years older than you are now). We also met when I was 18. Even though I love my husband dearly and truly believe that the tough times we've been through over the past 13 years have made us stronger, if he *ever* said, ""I could've manipulated you into having a threesome when you were 18 and naive. Be grateful I didn't,"" or anything like your husband said, his ass would be out on the curb so goddamn fast, it wouldn't even be funny. Even in the heat of an argument, that's not something a *normal* person says to their spouse."
"1) Current routine is as follows: AM: Either Neutrogena oil free moisture for combination skin OR Coppertone oil free faces (for days when I intend to leave the house) PM: Wash with Body Shop tea tree oil cleanser Body Shop tea tree toner on face and back of shoulders Body shop Vitamin E under eye cream Body shop tea tree oil night blemish lotion I will also do a mud mask 1-2 times weekly. Usually either a Mint Chocolate Chip (forget the brand name) or Freeman Stress Relief mask 2) Current routine has been in effect in full for about one month now. I am seeing results with zero breakouts and persistent redness is dissipating. 3) Yes. 5) I am looking to add exfoliation 2-3 times per week. I previously used the St. Ives Apricot Scrub with salicylic acid daily before finding this sub. I used the red Stridex pads in my teen years and they dried my skin out like crazy even with infrequent use so those are absolutely out of the question. Also regular use of a salicylic acid toner caused freaky dry skin (though it could have been other ingredients since it was a Neutrogena toner). I have read the FAQs and still don't really have a grasp on whether I should be using an AHA or BHA. I would like to add exfoliation to my routine because I have some patches of rough skin on my forehead, the corners of my nose, and my chin."

"1-30-17 is my ABSOLUTEL FAVOURITE, that jacket(?) is amazing. I really adore your use of colours like red, orange, and yellow.

"1. Burberry Effortless Eyebrow Defined (black). Close race between this product and the Charlotte Tilbury Wonder Brow, but I prefer the extra control that comes from a pencil. 2. NARS Soft Matte Concealer (Cannelle). Really, you could replace this with any pinpoint concealer. I'm just choosing the Soft Matte because it has the best shade range. 3. EMS Buriti Bronzer. I would die without bronzer, and this is my favourite one. Can double as a cream eyeshadow. 4. Charlotte Tilbury Matte Revolution Lipstick in Very Victoria. My perfect nude. Can double as a blush. 5. Charlotte Tilbury Matte Revolution in Walk of Shame. One of my favourite reds. Another red could honestly substitute here; I'm just not sure which one."
"1. Do your research on some of the people who you know will be there (and want to meet). Try to talk to them about ongoing projects they're working on that you find interesting. 2. Have a little ""pitch"" on hand about yourself. Nothing too formal-sounding - just who you are and something cool that you are working on (that is relevant to the industry - or friend group - you're trying to get into). Don't sell the product, but do sell your interest in it. 3. Don't frame yourself as being ""unemployed"", but ""looking for new opportunities"". Remember that you did X, Y, and Z relevant things in the past - establish a continuity of effort. 4. Don't interrupt other people's conversations. You can politely insert yourself (and will likely have to, as tends to be the pattern for networking events), but don't randomly thrust yourself into the middle of somebody else's sentence with your hand dangling. (You don't sound like this kind of person, but I see it happen FAR TOO OFTEN.) 5. FOLLOW UP AFTERWARD. I think this is the biggest thing - often people will exchange contact info and then nobody writes an email afterward to set up a coffee date. This is actually the most important step; otherwise going to the networking event will have been pointless! 6. White wine before red. No more than one glass per hour if you're on the entry side (or one glass per night if you're a lightweight). Also, don't spend the entire night gorging on the hor d'oeuvres. (I mean, have a couple - just don't be that person with 3 platefuls, y'know?) 7. If you're having a great conversation with somebody, don't be afraid to keep that going, but try not to occupy anybody for too long (unless it's, IDK, kismet or something). Make rotations! Talk to different kinds of people. They might all know each other and then come together later to mutually agree on your coolness. 8. Dress appropriately. As much as I hate to body-police, I've noticed too many women in low-cut shirts or with their giant gaps between their buttons (I have also inadvertently been the latter). Stay on the safe side. People are here to talk to you, not your outfit. Hopefully that is helpful - good luck!"
"1. I sucked my thumb till I was 6 and my front teeth are crooked. Previous dentists have said it's just cosmetic so I never got them fixed, because it was too much trouble and I didn't care that much. Well now I'm 34 and my gums have receded, especially around those teeth, and my dentist now says the crookedness is what made it worse in that spot. You said it makes it hard to clean, so it's not just cosmetic -- get your teeth fixed. And, while I'm at it, brush at least twice a day and floss at least once a day. 3. Point out to your boyfriend that he is telling you what you think and and how you feel. If that doesn't stop him in his tracks, or at least make him reconsider, red flag: controlling, lack of respect, and/or not seeing you as an equal. He should take your statements at face value when they're consistent (relatively, through time; or internally, logically speaking). 4. Never put what you want on a back burner (or take it off completely) based solely or largely on not hurting his feelings or, in most situations, on what he wants. Start off gently, if you're concerned, when you talk to him about it...but don't change what you choose to do if you don't think there's merit in his arguments."
"1. Lots of guitar players teach for extra money, but they would really rather be on stage if they could get paid enough to live off of it. Teaching is an art form and a skill! Seek out a teacher who *loves to teach* and has excellent communication abilities AND technical proficiency and knowledge, not just someone who is a good player or known on the local music scene as a performer. 2. Ask lots of questions. How long have you been teaching? Is this your full-time job? Where did you go to music school? What styles do you teach? Do you mostly teach beginners or do you also teach intermediate and advanced players? How many students do you have? etc. If a teacher only has a handful of students and/or has only been teaching for a few months, even if their prices are low, that's not a good sign. 3. The best teachers will help you put together a custom practice regimen and help you set goals based on *your* interests. Many teachers use a set curricula for their students and that is a good starting place and acceptable, but if you like heavy metal and your teacher wants you to start out by learning folk or children's songs, find a new teacher who is more suited to your playing style. 3. You are never too old to take lessons, and it's never too late to start lessons. Many professional musicians continue taking lessons and master classes and clinics throughout their careers. 4. The better teachers will put heavy emphasis on using a metronome. There is a good reason for this; don't argue. And, if a teacher doesn't have a high quality metronome in their teaching studio or doesn't use one, that's a major red flag. 5. Don't feel like you have to stick with a teacher if it's not working. It's actually not a bad idea to switch teachers every once in awhile anyway, just to get a variety of approaches. 6. As a student, you have several responsibilities. Show up early and tune &amp; warm up before your lesson starts, PRACTICE YOUR DAMN ASSIGNMENTS, pay your damn bill. You will not get better unless you practice and your teacher cannot practice for you. If you're not going to practice, don't waste your money on lessons. If you're not going to pay your bill or show up on time, don't waste your money or your teacher's time on lessons. Just be minimally responsible and it will be much better for everyone! Don't cancel if you can help it; if you MUST cancel, make sure that you follow your teacher's policy on cancellations and don't expect leeway on payment if they still charge you in accordance with their policy. This may be your hobby, but it's their job, and it's unfair of you to expect them to tolerate no-shows or late payment unless it's an emergency. Thank you for understanding! 7. DON'T BE AFRAID TO SPEAK UP! If you don't understand why your teacher is spending time on some topic, ask. If you want to learn something specific and you don't feel like your teacher is covering what you are interested in, say something! If you are too busy to practice much, tell your teacher. Be honest and straightforward; we are here to help YOU in your musical journey and we want to be useful to you. If you need help putting together a practice regimen that works with your schedule, we can help with that! If you need help understanding why some topic is important even if it seems boring or unnecessary to you, please ask! We want you to be a very active participant in this process. 8. Support your local music scene. If you find a great teacher, refer others to them. Go to their gigs, invite your teacher to your gigs. If you like their music, buy it. This business is cutthroat but it's also about helping the scene grow and helping each other out. We *all* benefit when there's strong support of local music. If you can make an introduction that you think would benefit someone, make it. If you want to meet someone, ask. Looking for a jam session? Want to start a band or find bandmates? Ask your teacher, they probably have info about this stuff. Looking to buy or sell stuff? Need advice about buying a guitar? Many teachers have hookups on this stuff. We're all in this together :)"

"1st, I'd say think minimalistically. Start with a BB Cream (one with SPF if possible), a bronzer that can double as shimmery eyeshadow (I like the Smashbox SoftLights in Baked Starburst), and waterproof mascara. Add a lip gloss or balm if you feel like it. *Note: I learned the hard way that lipsticks and festivals DON'T mix - picture red lipstick that had run all over my mouth. I looked like a vampire after a big meal... not attractive.* Basically, take products that are easily applied without a mirror if need be, and won't melt in your tent! 2nd, practice your festival makeup routine in the comfort of your own home. See how it works for you, and add/change/subtract products as you see fit. Hope this helps!!"
