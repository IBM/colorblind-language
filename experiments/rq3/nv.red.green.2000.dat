On Saturday, I fell in the shower so my back was messed up. Then on Sunday, I woke up with the devil's stomachache. Apparently green tea just makes it worse .____. And today, I nearly passed out in the parade due to the heat and standing there for two hours.
I've done both. Either way it's shitty. My liq tolerance is fucked high but my weed tolerance is dogshit, so it feels the same. And the feelings I get from both are complete opposites, so you would think it would kinda cancel each other out, but coming from a guy that greens off of one goddamn bowl, the weed takes over and it's just bad.
It is a green cheek omg
can be colorblind and still see green normally.
...and the fact that those juicy green lemons are delicious
Grass is always greener on the other side friend
Yeah sounds like 4chan with the greentexts
Little green ghouls!
When we first moved into our house EVERYTHING in the bathroom was lime green (toilet, bath sink, walls - the whole thing).
Can you explain how to not make it political if we need things changed in the world? A billion dollar business isn't going to cut into their profits by being green just because a Swedish 16 y/o asked them to. We need to make and 3nforce laws to do that.
I only distinguish my comments as mod when I'm speaking as a moderator, I'll do it with this comment. Most the time I'm just fucking around on the sub like anyone else, so no need to be green
As for what does Xbox smell like? Microsoft says the answer is fruit, herbs, and various styles of wood. ‚ÄúLynx Xbox is a fresh scent of pulsing green citrus, featuring top notes of kaffir lime and winter lemon, aromatic herbal middle notes of mint and sage, and woody bottom notes of patchouli and clearwood,‚Äù reads the product description. ‚ÄúContaining a range of natural essential oils, the Xbox Lynx range comes with a sleek new look and features a body spray, deodorant, and shower gel.‚Äù

Depending on where you live (To my knowledge) you can pick up basic antidepressants/anti anxiety meds without a prescription, I've been on some basic non-prescripted ones from walgreens for a little less than 2 months now and they do fine for me, I would suggest checking a nearby pharmacy for something like that. This is based off my own experience, so I'm sorry if it's not the right advice
I‚Äôve tried intermittent fasting, keto for the sake of it, paleo for the same reason, etc. Back when I ran track, I would do a juice cleanse for 1 week (only drinking a specific green juice). I‚Äôve found that dieting is one of those things I just do for the fun of variation. I‚Äôm at my healthiest when i‚Äôm eating clean and hitting 5-6 meals a day, 600-800 calories per meal depending on the time. Now, I mostly just eat IIFYM, but I‚Äôm bulking rn. On my cuts, I intermittent fast and eat one large meal thing (usually 3500/3600 cals) over a 4 hour window. Usually hit about 4100 cals during bulking szn.

It's not that I want siblings, I'm happy with the way things are, but it's fun to just wonder "what if" sometimes. Events in everyone's lives could've played a heck of a lot different with only a few things changed. &amp;#x200B; But yes, for many people the grass is always greener on the other side...

You could always consider encouraging your parents to pick up green habits. You can recycle more if you already don't, eat less meat (you don't have to give it up), walk, bike, skateboard, scooter, etc, to class, turn off appliances and stuff when they're not in use, vote or have your parents vote with the enviorment in mind, etc.

Ah, in golf we refer to it as birdie (-1), eagle (-2), and albatross (-3). There's no term for 4 under because that literally means a hole in one on a par 5 and golf balls are limited to 200 mph speed to limit the total distance, making it impossible to drive the green in one shot on a par 5. That's actually why the Taylormade M6 used to be illegal because they had to use a speed foam injector to limit the maximum ball speed, otherwise it exceeded 175-200 mph maximum before that. For above it's bogey (+1) then the double, triple, quadruple, then we just say 5 over par,6 over, and etc at that point.

Goodbye green donut boy, best man Avdol, stupid dog. We will miss you.
So we had this university event that we wanted to post to our school portal (where you get all your school updates, assignments schoolworks and everything). However, there is this one school official who OBJECTED, just because we chose a sponsor (who he says was known for green washing, he is the Environment Resources head of the university) So I was like, how do we respond? What I did was comment a lengthy post that basically says "*this event has been approved (and this will still happen even if you object)*"

Could you link your vids next time, makes them easier to find 1) I don't, ever heard of the burden of proof? If I claim that, to use the famous example, there is a small green teapot orbiting Saturn, it is up to me to prove that, not you to disprove that. I find any of the variants more plausible than the resurrection. Heard of the Fatima "miracle"? Mass hallucination is a thing. Unlikely, but possible I find this the most likely, the video mentions a reliable historical source for his miracles, do you know of it? A lot of the alleged evidence against all of the above rest on the Bible, which is not fact. 2) He does. If you were an all powerful being, and you could save billions of lives with no effort, would you? A God that wouldn't doesn't seem worthy of worship. Not only does this contradict the previous point, it is disgusting. If God is all powerful, there must be a way for him to make the baby live AND that preacher appear 500 years in the future. If God can see the butterfly effect, he could have set up life in a way so that our cells are not vulnerable to cancer. If there is no way for good things to happen to everyone here on earth, how do you propose doing it in heaven. Final question: Do you believe in science when it comes to cosmology and evolution?
Some sort of hot dog cut up, with seasoning and some cucumbers(or some other large green vegetable that i cant remeber) and some taco shells. I did this in 8th grade after watching ratatuie...

Bullshit! I will pay MONEY to bet on the fact ur not green.
/u/thatdamnFO I believe your expertise could be useful here EDIT: I have a good idea of what he's going to say. Something along the lines of "don't, go reserve." Then again he gets destroyed by the big green weenie (read: the US Army) on the daily. Ah yes from 100 days ago: "I personally say don't go active, you'll be sitting on your ass or do some dumb shit detail." He does a lot of sitting on his ass and dumb detail in case you couldn't tell.

oolong and green so far, i also drank some wheatgrass juice this morning though. any tea suggestions?
Damnnn same tho but in the summer. I had spammed the shit out of r/teenagers of it. It was so fucking depressing. I crushed on her for 3 months, and then took me 3 months to get over her. Sadly I didn;t want to but I had to accept it. She was pale, blonde, green eyes. My fucking type along with a smart ass personality etc. However though she was 14 so age difference was pretty big. I guess it was a win/loose And btw: No we didnt send each other anything, it was just "romantic" convos all the time or just talking about shit. Still friends tho.

A global movement that only countries that already use green energy care about. China and India alone produce more pollution than anywhere else, and China just by itself produces 20x more ocean pollution than any other country. China still runs on 90% fossil fuels if my memory serves. Her global movement only reaches into countries that care about the environment.
The real question is why you are using the green theme
Hi just passing through from r/all.. Can anyone ID that green backpack the guy in the background is wearing?
You know those tendies greentext stories? r/tendies is for posting in the character of the protagonist of those stories
So? America's stance on green energy has changed since 1751. Much greener than we were even as recent as 50 years ago.

You can't tax your way to a greener climate. All that does is make it harder for poor people to live.

They mainly do it in areas with lots of dead plants and other dead stuff, but it can work anywhere. I'm from Virginia, so we have tons of greenery and forests, but it is so humid the fire would be put out by existing! I'm pretty sure there is a documentary about it, but I don't remember exactly. You could always do some more research if you would like
Yeah there's a lot wrong with this one. Who the hell gave this the green light?

New Vegas also had a great weapon selection and the use of different ammo made it uniquely cool. Agreed about the world though. For all it's greenish samey look, I never feel like I've fully done justice in exploring FO3 enough, there just seems to be so many places to investigate. The subway system makes it feel even more massive with how complex it is, something 4 missed a trick by not implementing in my opinion.
If you cook kale right they taste like collard greens, so fuck all y'all!

I'm fairly sure it was just as a symbol of lasting life, not always as a prayer., 'cause evergreen trees don't die during winter.
Yeah, you're too naive. Sorry, dude. The elites don't give a fuck about you. They know and they *don't care*. Rich people are perfectly fine destroying the planet, mostly because someday we'll be colonizing Mars or some other shit and you can bet your ass that only billionaires will be able to hop in. Like, I get that you *want* change. That's good. But this? This ain't it, chief. Go. Protest. Vote for left-wing green governments. That's *actual* change. I won't debate further because neither of us are changing our minds. But do consider what I'm saying here.
And that's really wholesome and cool and everything... but why? Obviously he was loved by all, but it seems odd to completely exclude a major character from all future Pokemon movies because the actor they had in mind for it passed away years before the first film was ever even green lit, much less in production.
Yes it does. His gigafactory uses lithium out of a single sea from an area that already suffers from drought. Teslas cost more CO¬≤ emissions than a normal gasoline car and take up on that carbon footprint you'd have to drive approximatly 10 years with the same battery. But the battery only lasts 7 years. And if you don't charge with green energy, it's just like driving with oil
But they had green alligators...

i was reffering to that green thing on the shelve but you're right about that shit
Middle Eastern isn‚Äôt a race, it can refer to more than 3 races, Arabs, Turkic and Persians. That is if you exclude the diverse Israel. Each one of those races are diverse too, which is why many people can‚Äôt tell them apart, but as an Arab I can easily tell a Persian from an Arab without hearing them, it‚Äôs a bit difficult between Persians and Turks but the latter tend to be slightly more tanned and there is a high abundance of green eyes among them.
Spread my legs, not greenhouse gases
I remember that there was no hunger, no sprinting, no food stacking and the grass was green as shit in minecraft.
Aaah, the green rake, now i see.
I mean eventually the sun will basically explode destroying the entire solar system, no matter how long people are/aren‚Äôt here. Earth can‚Äôt deal with that. All that green house stuff will be caused by the sun expanding, not by human pollution or lack there of.

I really should get into them more. I've heard most of their albums but like I said I don't know everything. I'd still consider myself a fan though.

I think you're underestimating the time it takes for ecosystems to adjust. [Check this out.](http://www.greenfacts.org/en/ecosystems/figtableboxes/figure7-1-time-scales.htm) In addition, some people place value on the existence of any and all species. (I do, for example.)
* I didn't decide to become vegan, rather, I decided to remain vegan. I was raised vegan from birth. Why did I decide to remain vegan? It just made sense. I love the food. I always feel healthy. Blood work results from my doctor were amazing. The idea of eating animals was repulsive. I didn't want to deal with the guilt of knowing that a bunch of animals died to put food on my plate. I liked the idea behind veganism: causing the least amount of harm in the world. (how can you not get behind an idea like that?) * I have been vegan for my whole life. (19 years) * I don't eat dairy, eggs, or fish. I do eat soy. * Free-range meat/eggs is an improvement over factory farming, but I still don't believe in taking the lives of animals, or taking things that don't belong to us. * Favorite meals: Tofu green bean eggplant stir fry. Tofu almond water chestnut stir fry. * I love tofu and seitan. Fake meats are usually delicious. Tempeh is gross. **Have you ever had tofu/fake meats before?** Being vegan from birth has been the easiest thing in the world. (My mother is the most fantastic vegan cook) Going vegetarian after being raised on a diet of meat may prove difficult, especially if you don't get exposed to some really good vegan cuisine. Anyways, I hope you find the answers you're looking for!
Speaking of, goddamn it pissed me off when it was the ghost army that came off the boats, not Prince Imrahil and his Swan Knights. It was supposed to be a great victory of Men, as they came aware of the fact that they *could* stand against The Enemy, they they *were* worthy of inheriting Middle Earth. Instead, we got green, glowy, deus ex machina CGI. I wanted my Swan Knights, dammit!
I was 35, she was 22,and I suddenly came down with a guilty conscience about her age just as I got the green light.
If I had to guess, Osprey builds the price of the warranty into the product. There‚Äôs no way my hiking pack actually costs $250 to make, so the margin there, combined with the right to refuse obvious abuse (you lit it on fire), probably keeps them in the green. Plus they‚Äôre just exceptionally well built so the majority of packs wouldn‚Äôt need to go back. My day pack is 7 years old now and I‚Äôve used it daily since buying it. It‚Äôs literally been all over the world and everything that needs to work still is.
In poorer neighborhoods the residents on EBT generally eat lot's of easily accessible and cheap junk food. As a result of bad eating habits health issues arise and that taxes medicaid. I'm in NYC and over the last few years they've added lots of green produce carts popping up around the neighborhood. They all take EBT cards and are pretty popular so there is hope.

What!? They changed the green skittles flavour from Lime to fucking Apple!? When did that boneheaded move happen? I was apparently too quick to judge yesterday. I was walking past a group and a girl exclaims to her friends, "Eww, I hate green skittles." I made fun of her to the friend I was with because seriously, what kind of person hates lime? Thank you for informing me, apparently my derision was unfounded and I owe green skittles girl an apology wherever she is.
If you're a grad and more than 80% of your intake has moved on within two years, the grass is definitely greener elsewhere. That being said, always be cogniscent of your position and your own growth, both career wise and financially to judge whether or not the job is for you. E.g. if after two years of positive performance reviews your take home income increases by less than 15%, consider moving to a better paying job.
I always take my green boots to protect me.
Most actual pre-ban Absinthe's didn't have that much in it to begin with. There is much misconception and myth surrounding Absinthe. Most of the perceived ill-effects are more to do with the fact that its ~110 proof than any herb it contained. That and some cheap pre-ban absinthe's used a dye to make it green, the dye was essentially poison. The history of this particular liqueur is very interesting.
You are not alone my friend. Peas are little green bastards.

You mean like mixing your green curry with your pad thai and massaman beef? or as in putting various veggies and meat into a green curry? (The latter is standard practise in Thailand, but mixing different dishes is definitely weird.)

All her message has been is to listen to the experts and shame on you for not doing so already. Nobody likes to be called out by a child. When it comes to something as important as this...the habitability of our planet...people need to listen to those with expertise and hard actions need to be taken. Namely against the major corporations who are generating 71% or so of our greenhouse emissions.
It's one of the main reasons I don't vote for the smaller green party in my country. I kinda empathise with many of their policy points, and would love for them to win some seats at the big table, if not for their irrational stance on nuclear, and their persitance to make it one of their major issues. Sure, we should invest in renewable energy, but closing down our plants now is just a mind boggling bad idea because where the hell are we going to get our power? We had a few shutdowns recently and the country was barely scraping the power together left and right. We do not have reliable facilities to replace them.
Some friends came over so I made lasagna and picked up a green salad and sourdough bread.
Or a colorless green idea.
Sigh, to think they took over making Cadbury eggs. I always forget about that. Maybe it's just as well I focused on Russell Stover eggs when that went on clearance, and for whatever reason I didn't find any Cadbury eggs left when I checked a few stores(mostly Walgreens) for clearance Easter candy.
Yes. Three weeks of paid vacation per year is enough to make most of us green with envy. My girlfriend doesn't earn Personal Time Off by the days....she earns it *by the hour*.
Isn't there a browser extension that turns peoples usernames green if they have /r/gonewild posts or something?
Height and baldness. Amount of ice cream consumed and "greenness" of grass.
I drove 3 hours once from a service station north of Dallas all the way to 51st street in Tulsa without stopping. It was at night, and hit every light green through the little towns.
My wife thinks everyone spends every non working hour together except for herself and I. She lives in a grass is always greener mind set. I want to show her that we are normal, that most people play their own games, own hobbies, or watch TV separately. Which of us has it right?
That's a real negative way you go into social situations. Some of us don't give a shit what you make. As long as you don't shove it into our faces. If we know each others income then the restaurant should be within the lower income person's comfortable means. If you suggest a place that cost $100 a plate, then hell yeah I'm counting on you paying. So you didn't lift a finger and you had a chauffeur. I had both parents at home every night by 7pm. My dad taught me cars, tools, building, and talked to me about getting laid. My mom went to all of my events and taught me about housework, sewing, and love. The point is when they sound jealous, remind them of the things they had that you never did. We all want the greener grass. We just seem to forget that greener grass is made by the manure piled on. And my life has some pretty green grass.
I'm a runner too, and I generally find that we're pretty wary and respectful of the rules of the road. For the first time ever yesterday, I almost ran over some asshole runner. I had a green light (it was green for a while), and I saw him approaching the intersection. I wrongfully assumed that he would wait for the light to change in the spirit of self-preservation, but I was mistaken. He was about six inches off my car door when I drove past. I watched in my rear view mirror as he forced the car behind me to stop so he could cross. If your time is that big of a deal, you shouldn't be running on the street. I mostly run trails, but if I do a street run I avoid busy streets and cross on long stretches of road when it's clear.
I've thought about this. **How the Grinch Stole Christmas** It would be a contemporary take in which he masterminds some financial scheme that bankrupts every citizen in Whoville. A militia forms and storms the mountain. There would be an outdoor camera shot facing the cave's entrance. You hear screaming and see nothing but chunks of bloody green fur being tossed out the entrance. The film's closing zoom-out shot is the (now furless, bloodied) Grinch literally crucified on the main Christmas tree at the town square.
Those gigantic maple trees in the greenbelt behind the house... Yeah they are amazing and yeah they make it feel like living in the woods. Until November comes and there's a two foot deep pile of leaves in your back yard and on your roof. Oh and just wait until the first really wild wind storm hits.
Let me pull my waistband up a little and put in my retainer. Okay. So, Bruce Banner transforms into a big green rage beast. He has a separate mental disorder that essentially means he has two personalities. The two are often linked but not necessarily. Aboard the helicarrier, his Hulk personality takes over, causing him to lose control and attack anything and everything. His Banner personality fought to regain control, this is why he manages to fall on an abandoned building even though he was still in green body form. Later on in the film, when he remarks that his secret is "I'm always angry," he's showing that he can control the physical transformation without also undergoing a mental transformation. It's risky for Banner to fight in his green body because he does run the risk of becoming enraged and having the Hulk personality take over. But he seems to be able to manage it during the New York battle scene.
Some asshole in freshman year of high school during football practice was recovering from a cold.  He intentionally hawked up all kind of green phlegm and walked up behind me and spit it right on my right shoulder pad.
Spinal Tap? Nigel's green X-ray skeleton t-shirt?
Grass is always greener on the other side homie
People who sit at green lights because they‚Äôre playing on their phone or just not paying attention in general.
This is one of my favourite comfort foods and it's pretty cheap. Dice 2 sweet onions and cook on medium heat in a deep saucepan with a tablespoon of bacon fat. After they become translucent, place two bunches of roughly chopped collard greens on top and cover with a lid. Turn heat down to medium/low and let cook until the collards are tender. Stir occassionally. Its so easy but so delicious.
I did read his 100 day plan, and he very clearly states his intention is to bring jobs back to America (the basis of his platform really). What I'm skeptical about is if it will work. His plan is to make it cheaper for companies to have their money here so that it's cheaper to build factories here and such. I'm skeptical because there's no guarantee that companies will move their money back into the U.S. What I've read on his tax plan (non-partisan source) says that his plan will work for growing the economy if he can offset the massive deficit he'll create with the tax cuts (fingers crossed).  I agree with this, and I'm concerned about this myself. I'm hoping this effort to convince Trump that climate change exists works, or that someone will figure out a way to make him think that green energy is profitable for business. Disclaimer: I didn't vote for either Hillary nor Trump
I work in a poor section of NYC, I can't find a supermarket within 5 miles of where I work. What I can find is a McDonalds, Burger King, Checkers, Popeye's, tons of deli's that take EBT cards and sell the card holder hot food (it's against the law). They can buy a 2 liter bottle of soda and 4 bags of chips with the EBT card (EBT is welfare or public assistance btw). We have green carts around the neighborhood selling fruit and vegetables and people usually flock to them since the prices are great. But that's the only healthy option, most of the residents don't drive, are overweight, and second generation welfare recipients. It's really sad, seeing children running around with bottles of soda and chips, eating a hot dog or McDonalds for lunch and dinner. Worst part is most of them don't have any other options. I wish I had a good solution but making eating healthy a cheaper option than eating crap food. I personally eat healthy, mostly bring my food from home.
Don't care. Still love it, and I'm still able to order the old recipe whenever I go albeit without the green ravioli.
I started eating more greens, and taking less drugs.
Here's something to think about. If you're building a solar thermal system yourself it might still be worth it, but give this a read. http://www.greenbuildingadvisor.com/blogs/dept/musings/solar-thermal-really-really-dead Also, low flow shower heads have come a long way in recent years. You should give them a try.
Easily summed up my thoughts on online dating. "The grass is greener" syndrome is so prevalent. Even if you're an amazing person and have a great connection they go home that night and keep swiping. Your value is minimal even in the best circumstances because there are so many options out there. I feel like online dating is actually removing an already diminished value of love/romance/partnership etc. The online dating companies will all tell you that its easier to find someone now, which is true, it's also easier to find someone to replace the one you just found.
Avatar. Just after watching that film, being on natures side and against the side who was originally our ally, really opened my eyes to a more natural and green lifestyle.
I don't follow what that has to do with this. I would never fuck a green horse, that sensual beast needs a doctor, not a dicking.
tl;dr - Rant about Walgreens being a shit employer. Worked for Walgreens as well from 2010 to 2014. Every time I got my review in August or September, I'd get my raise in December. Then hey! Minimum wage went up in January to above my raise and now I'm back to minimum! Fuck that company. I'd get guilted into covering shifts which I was too dumb and young to say fuck you until I grew a pair my last year there. I trained new employees as well and never got any compensation for it because I was good at a mindless fucking job. Hell, I'd request 3 weeks off every year to visit family in Europe and threatened to quit if they didn't give it to me because I had a good relationship with a lot of regulars. The sales tags were like Buzzfeed titles, grab your attention but entirely mislead customers because they're illiterate. Fuck the buyers at corporate as well since they'd order enough bullshit from China for the entire company but it would be thrown on clearance after 3 months since they wouldn't sell. All so some dickhead with an MBA that's never been a peon could buy a new car. I only ever go back in to visit old coworkers.
The main minor change i could think of that affected my life was a joint birthday 7 years ago. Was meant to be a nice quiet night in the pub, instead i ended up drinking in a mates house before being talked into going to the next town to a nightclub. I had never been in that nightclub in my life, never planned on it either (hate nightclubs), and was wearing combats, climbing shoes, bright green jacket and a peace tshirt. wasn't even wearing matching socks. I ended up meeting an ex there, we spent 7 years together and had a wonderful time and only recently broke up but have remained friends. Neither of us were meant to go out that night but we both did and I wouldn't swap those 7 years for anything
Soul food. Fried chicken (popeyes texture, kfc flavor), collard greens, mac and cheese, and some mashed potatoes just because. Have some sweet tea to wash it down
R Kelly with Lady Gaga - "I could be the cream in your butt", when it's actually "I could be the green in your blunt"
Maybe if we invent a cheap "green" paper towel, we can stop using those shitty-ass hand dryers!
Also, pull up far enough so you're over the detectors in the pavement or you'll never get a green light.
Fell through my grandparents glass doors in their conservatory when I was a kid. Pushed through the greenhouse glass doors at my parents when I was a kid. Jumped off the top of a slide when I was a kid. I think that covers the main three.
You could try a silicone lube, they don't dry not nearly as fast. I try to avoid Astroglide because it contains parabens, which are a weird group of chemicals that it's probably best to leave out of your body; that said, Astroglide makes a natural variety that doesn't have that. It's in a green bottle. EDIT: Randomly quoted text deleted. Not sure how it got there.
2000 Subaru Legacy sedan. I borrow it from my dad when I can't bus somewhere. It's awesomely snappy for an automatic, and I win all the green light takeoffs
I dreamed about huge field with green gra... Oh who I am kidding, my best dream was when I fucked a hot girl and I was a virgin.
Once I hit my 40's, just mentioning your vasectomy has gotten me a couple green lights!
I want you to take the frankenstein shit, the deer shit, the green monster, the bling and the bling bling and I want you to roll it into one joint.
Yep, we exist. *non-green fistbump*
The airport greenscreen backdrop is also terrible, as is Tony's floating head in the Iron Man suit

A remake of Forrest Gump, with every single roll played by Morgan Freeman. This movie will involve the most gratuitous use of CGI, green screens, and digital extras since the Star Wars prequels. Forrest? He's played by Morgan Freeman. His love interest, Jenny Curran? That's Morgan Freeman after a digital sex change. Lt. Dan? You guessed it. Morgan Freeman. The scenes in the Vietnam War will be whole platoons of Morgan Freemans. The scene at the anti-war rally will involve Morgan Freeman speaking to a crowd of tens of thousands of Morgan Freemans of various ages, sexes, and heights. Every single character in the movie will be played by Morgan Freeman, without exception. Every main cast member, secondary cast member, and random extra will be played by Morgan Freeman. Any animals, such as dogs or horses, will be digital abominations of a horribly distorted Morgan Freeman.
I was pretty slow to pick up on some things. I grew up in the suburbs, there's a green area / mini field in the middle of the street. Our house has a pretty good view of it. During the summer my parents would always want me home really early. I used to get so annoyed, they'd want me home by 8, it gets dark around 10 &amp; they can clearly see what my friends and I were up to. I used to always come back late and get in trouble. It took a whole summer of this before my sister spelled it out for me that it wasn't a case of my parents having a silly rule and more about me proving that I could be trusted to follow their rules. To be fair, I was a good kid and if they'd said if I can come home at X time every day for 2 weeks then they'd increase my curfew, well then I'd have been back early every time.
Watched a friend of mine throw her keys away in one of those big green roller cans lots of cities use, rather than the trash she had in her other hand. She finished the text message, closed her phone, and chucked it into the can.
That‚Äôs a 14-year study. There were greenhouse gases by then, factories-upon-factories were pumping out arms for the wars. Today‚Äôs studies have the backing of over 100-years worth of data.
We were about 12-ish and I was the DM. The party was attacked by a giant green slime. One of my friends asked me to describe it. "It's like a giant 'booger monster' chasing you guys". Without missing a beat he says "I use the last wish on my 'ring of wishes' and wish for a giant finger to pick it". Yeah, I always read that in D&amp;D there are no "winners" but to this day I think Larry actually won a game of D&amp;D that afternoon.
Mondegreens!
My first girlfriend was a foreign student from Thailand. She made me a salad with leafy greens, mushrooms, and so much lemongrass pepper. It was like sucking on a lemon while shooting yourself in the mouth with a pistol.
Specifically for High School: Dont get stuff out of vending machines, its a rip off. Bring it from home. If you do stuff after school with friends, instead of going and paying for food or going to a movie, join clubs. Consider taking collections of things you had a kid and selling them. While working a part-time job is admirable, try to find ways to make money quicker. Find something you're good at, make a little business. I bought a $400 Canon camera with money I had already saved up, and began taking taking photos of my brother's baseball games. I shopped them and did the printing (at Wal-mart or Walgreens, little league parents arent smart enough to tell the difference) and made a ton of money, and parents loved it because it was still way cheaper than paying for a real photographer. Other teams started asking to do it as well, and before I knew it I had a little photography business. Hope this helps.
The whole green part?
Should try the Windows XP green field.
I gave a fuck about mine and have never been able to find work in my field. I'd much rather have something marketable. Grass isn't greener over here.
Snipe someone *behind you* with a green shell whilst power sliding. Gotta make sure that 2nd place knows that they can't challenge the king.
My eyes are green or hazel I can‚Äôt really tell
no no no, Let's start, i like my women green
Depends when and where. If I'm turning left on a green light, I'll always signal. Same thing if I'm making a sudden right with someone close behind me. If there are few cars in sight and enough space, I'll do a blindspot check and then just merge over. Lane changes, again, depending on the situation, are a lot more flexible.
The forest green? I like the look of those.
I discussed Fleetwood Mac with Marc Maron for about 10 minutes in a green room, despite not knowing anything about Fleetwood Mac. He's super nice, if very reserved. Margaret Cho and I chatted briefly about comedy before a show. She's an absolute sweetheart.
I always tell new girls that they will know the code for bananas by the end of their first shift and will probably know green peppers and sweet onions too (some days we don't sell much of those but so. many. bananas)  More codes! *Watermelons- 4032 *Corn- 4025 * Pickles- 4215 * Cucumbers- 4062 * Seedless cucumbers- 4593 * Roma Tomatoes- 4087 * Tomato: Beefsteak- 4799 Slicing- 3151

"here, i'll give you these bits of green paper for the last bread you own." "LOL! eat 12-gauge, Mr. Gates."
Earlier this year a few blocks from my house, I walked across the street after not paying attention to the crosswalk signal. I saw traffic stopped in one direction so I assumed it was clear, but there was a green light for the other side to make left turns, and a guy had to stop on a dime to avoid running me over. He understandably looked angry at me, and I apologized to him. I almost died, and I made a fool out of myself by not thinking to check the crosswalk signal. This was a moment that will linger in my head for the rest of my life.
green tea or water
What's a greenway?
Ok first of all let‚Äôs not get ahead of ourselves. If I were to die right now I‚Äôd praise the lord and so would everyone around me too. Now to answer your question... probably a green fidget spinner I found in the grass.
"A year from now, you'll wish you started today." Just make small changes and stick to them. Drink more water and less soda / beer. Add a (good-tasting) salad to your diet. Add a side of greens to each meal. Eat fruit instead of cake. Download some podcasts / audiobooks to listen to and go for a walk. Don't do all of those at once. It will be too much too quickly. Pick one or two and make them habits. You don't have to go 100% clean eating and join a gym right away. Small changes that you stick to are more effective than big changes that you don't stick to. I would suggest finding a breakfast that is good for you, that you can prepare easily, and that you enjoy. I usually have coffee and bacon and eggs. Easy, and has caffeine, fat, and protein to fill you up and fuel your bike ride. I have known some people to go without breakfast and do just fine. And some who feel legitimately sick after eating breakfast. But I need some sort of fuel. Trust me, you will be so glad you did. It won't happen immediately, but you'll realize at some point that you *want* to go for a walk or you *want* to work out. There will be days that you don't want to or you don't have time to, but when you notice a lack of motivation, make sure you don't have a lack of discipline. And one day you will look in the mirror and do a double take..... "God damn..... I look good." Take it from a guy who avoided mirrors for most of his life. I hated how I looked. Now I love how I look. It's something I can look at and be proud of. I put in the effort and there is the result. Not to mention my health is miles above what it used to be and I have probably avoided health issues that were in my future.
‚ÄúAll you greenhorns who never seen a Covenant up close, this is gonna be your lucky day!‚Äù
Yeah, it is, though. Nothing green is necessary to make a salad, it's just an uncooked medley of various foods just combined a bowl.  What'd you ever think pasta salad was?
My husband is lactose intolerant, and green peppers do something to my digestive tract that nobody should ever have to smell. He says one day our friends are going to find us sitting in our living room staring each other down, him eating cheese by the fistful and me chomping on a green pepper, never breaking eye contact. And they will run far, far away.
You are a Video editor, so you can edit my green clothes out of the green screen
So, what you're telling me is that some dispensary is going to be the next Walgreens?
Exactly!! He needs to spend $1,000 for the gesture to have been "worth it". And it's not like he's gonna stop doing it now that he knows Walgreen's managers are pushovers.
I turn into a green rage monster and submit my enemies to a smashing beat down. Once the rage subsides I usually awaken naked in a random location. Those airline miles are really starting to add up :)
Greenland is not green Iceland is not all made of ice
Pineapple, pepperoni, and green olive pizza.
China's investing a lot in green technology. And I think one of their top universities teleported something once.
Fuck that particular shade of green. I've seen it twice since moving to PNW and was suspicious the whole day
This argument sounds a lot like "If we start letting gays marry, next people will be marrying animals!" Require that everyone in a marriage be a human being of the age of consent and at least be able to name, from memory, everyone else they are married to, with the obvious exception for individuals who are diagnosed with a memory disorder. Additionally, married individuals should be able to prove, in situations where fraud is suspected, that they communicate with everyone they're married to at least once a month, with the obvious exception for military service personnel or covert operations. And an exchange of marriage vows for money, employment, of any similar agreement is illegal. Really, these protections already make sense to prevent people using marriage for green cards or strong-arming children into arranged marriages.  Can they all name each other? Do they all maintain regular contact with everyone? And even besides that, do you honestly think all of them would want to tie their legal and financial responsibilities to each other?  What, the employees? Ruled out as marriage in exchange for employment.
$1 million in total bank accounts plus an amount of Walgreens stock (not sure on the amount).
No, this is in downtown green Bay basically.
I lived on Green Machine for a couple weeks. Don't let the green scare you. It's delicious
There was a girl who I worked with for a group project who had green eyes and a bit of a lisp. I didn't really think much of it until I spoke to her, and I realized it was pretty damn cute, and I'm not one to use that word often or lightly
And my point is that real people will be harmed in the future, and a significantly larger amount of people at that. Unfortunately it's literally a situation of we have to pick which one to pull out the fire and which to let burn, and I'm of the mind that keeping the human species viable in the future is more important than 174,000 families. https://www.usda.gov/oce/climate_change/SAP4_3/CCSPFinalReport.pdf Give that a read. Within 40 years, longer and harsher heat waves, coupled with accelerated animal migration, could leave grain crops failing almost half the time. Growing periods during the year would shorten. The entire planet's average temperature could go up by several degrees. Entire oceans could get warm enough at the caps to cause enough melting to raise the global coast up to a foot. Natural ecosystems would be disrupted which would have vast, complicated consequences. Those changes in ecosystems would effect natural fresh water sources. Decreased precipitation in the late stages will help the entire planet literally bake.  The best part? *All of that is if things progressed at the same rate they were going when the report was made, in 2008.*  if we increase green house gas production, it'll happen sooner. If we **severely** decrease green has gas production it will happen later. But it is going to happen no matter what. Literally all we can do right now is try and influence when. With significant advancements in technology, we could attempt to reverse it but we need to make it there to do that.  So yes, I'm not worried too much about 174,000 families in the face of the entire 8-11 billion (in the year 2050) people that will be affected. It's not even really environmental concerns, it's literally our house is on fire and we are debating whether or not we should try and put it out because the stuff that lives in the reservoir needs that water.
Yeah but if you lower your standards that much you only get sex once then it turns green and falls off.
Live in a swamp and realize it isn't easy being green. Also Ms. Piggy dominates me.

(I'm from MN, so sorry to those who prefer "soda") I usually drink a pop per day. I'm trying to eat a bit healthier (nothing major, just some simple changes), so I want to give up this habit. I don't need the actual pop or the caffeine; it's just that it's something that's real fucking tasty that I can look forward to when I get home from class or whatever. To be clear, I am specifically talking about calories, etc, and not sugar as I take good care of my teeth. I am not really a fan of diet. I'd like to get into drinking tea, but I don't like green tea, which is the only kind I've had, and I don't know what other flavors are like. A lot of fruit juices, e.g. Tropicana, have just as many calories per serving as Coke, except that a "serving" is 8 oz. ([relevant](http://images2.memegenerator.net/ImageMacro/4892975/FUCK-THAT-SHIT.jpg?imageSize=Medium&amp;generatorName=Yao-Ming-meme)). So, what are some good alternatives that aren't unhealthy?
The grass is always greener, but you'll find that life's not perfect anywhere. You might find a country more suited to your individual taste, but there's a good chance they won't let you in either (expatriating is more difficult than you might realize). If you feel the need, then by all means, move, but I don't think America is as bad as you imagine it is.
"Grass is greener over here, you're the creep who keeps it clear" Verse Chorus Verse - Nirvana Yep, I know Cobain did not really focus on his lyrics, but by god do I feel a connection to these ones. The saccharine sound and image just...fit.
heh. Don't want your benefactor to know you bought rolling papers, eh? Don't worry, it just shows up as a store name and an address and/or phone number. So, if you bought something from say, Walgreens, it might show up as "WALGREENS 123 ANY ST. xxx-xxx-xxxx" and show the charge.
When they said on the news that Michael Jackson had died i turned to my mother and said "who's that?" But my first phone was a nokia with a monochromatic screen (default all green but could be changed) and you had to press 7 four times to write s
Rice with butter, salt, and pepper. Or rice with teryaki sauce, green onion, seaweed, and sesame seeds. I also try to keep my stash of Amy's frozen dinners from running out; they're much cheaper at Target than my grocery store.
Southeast US: collard greens. None of my friends from the west coast have ever heard of them.
Move to greenland
So... Apply for another green card like everyone else has to do. If your friend is so great for the American society/economy, I don't doubt he'll get approved for it (or just move to California. Fuck this lawless state).
Soylent green.
I've talked to people at work all day about how they have a bathtub full of water and 300 dollars worth of canned food and shit. I'm like you guys, I've been through 3 of these things with nothing more than half a pantry of green beans and a gallon of distilled water in the garage.
American in Montreal here... they have this rule on this crazy island that you can't turn right on a green forward arrow, and only on a green circle. Even after being here a year I am still having a hard time with it.
Well, that would make it difficult. Time to move to greener pastures?
Brussel sprouts, my mom would always boil them. Now I fry them in bacon fat and sprinkle them with bacon. Way better. Also something similar with cauliflower, fry it in the bacon fat, add some bread crumbs and green onions. Btw, my cholesterol level is 140, you can't eat this way all the time (even though you might want to).

Wow what fucking scum bags! Also AV isn't really needed, all you need to do is be smart regarding what you download/open. Granted I'm an IT guy but I would run Windows 7 with no AV for years and never have any viruses/malware. I've moved to greener pastures with Linux :)

He makes her breakfast, they have a nice morning filled with hugs and kisses, romantic comments, following a nice lunch, a trip to buy some new shoes, some surprise flowers, followed by a movie or her choice and a nice candle lit dinner. During this time there's a flash back where she reviews if you did anything to piss her off all day. If all is green. Penetration for the guy takes 5 minutes, hard and fast, man comes, followed by 20 minutes of going down on her until she's off. Then she goes takes a shower and goes to sleep.
Buy a fur coat and a green dress, neither of which would be real. Pay off debts (house, car, whatever) max out investments, create new investment funds that can be maxed out annually, and then invest whatever is left in a variety of local businesses. Keep my job, use my newly freed up income (minimal bills!!) to fund retirements and investments as well as my HSA through my employer. Build up wealth so I can retire when I want. That amount of money won‚Äôt let me retire yet, but it gives me a lot of room to manage my retirement and bring it much closer. And then probably purchase some skins on Fortnite. Gotta have some fun, right?
My feet were cold for a bit because I didn't want to commit, as if my life would be markedly more interesting and exciting if I was single. Which was of course bollocks, I was unhappy when I was single because the grass was greener on the other side. She told me she was pregnant 2 months after we got engaged (which was not romantic in the slightest, more my acceding to her desires), and now I couldn't be happier.
I have green eyes. That's technically 2% but it's close enough!
Getting stuck behind minivans. Minivan drivers are the scourge of the Earth. When you're driving 5 mph below the speed limit....it's because you're behind a minivan. When the traffic light goes green, but you don't move for 10 seconds....it's because you're behind a minivan.
Because people aren‚Äôt gonna be bullied around by a 16 year old with Aspergers. 1st world countries are living in the greenest age in existence. With solar power, electric cars, partially zero emissions cars, bans on plastic, bans on straws, the list goes on. You know what would have been more heroic of her? Is going to start a movement to clean up the 3rd world shit holes that have more garbage in their ocean than water, air that you need a respirator to just walk around and about, and absolutely no regulations on almost anything to do with the environment. There‚Äôs literal scientific data on pollution heat maps and where the most toxic environments are, and they aren‚Äôt anywhere close to where her attention was towards.
Lol. Might have to jump fence, then. Grass sounds pretty green over there!
Thomas Midgley Jr., the inventor of leaded gasoline. Leaded gasoline put huge amounts of lead into the environment and probably caused more cases of lead toxicity than any other source of lead. Chronic lead exposure in children is associated with decreased intelligence and executive function. There‚Äôs even evidence linking lead exposure with violence. Some people have speculated that the rise of violent crime in the 80s and 90s was linked to lead exposure and the subsequent sharp decline in violent crime was due to it being banned. Oh, and he also invented the first CFCs, which are potent ozone depletors and greenhouse gases.
I also hate Cilantro (the green leafy part of the plant), but I love coriander (the round seeds of the plant that are used as a spice).
I bought a 600mW green laser for $600, because I wanted another of the same laser I bought 4 days before.
Wow this is so me. I'm still in college and I live with my parents over the summer but I wish I was independent. They don't allow me to live my life freely, but hey, the grass is always greener
Rotel canned spicy tomato and green chilli chunks
Hey, hey, hey. I took the green because it was the closest to my hotel in Newton. Didn't do any of the other stuff though. Also, I didn't find Bostonians to be rude or assholes at all. Actually, people were generally more friendly than here in Chicago.
Im a greens ( far left) voter and i would love some nuclear power. Its clean, its cheap its safe and its a good stop gap before wind/ solar etc take off.
Aliens; i know he was a relatively green commander but how do you not ask what weapons can and cant be used before sending your troops into the reactor then having to neuter when they get down there
it definitely does. When I worked in produce, we'd put garbage bags over the bananas if the shipment we received was too green. We'd also put bananas in the avocados to make them ripen faster for making guac.
Really many of the documentaries surrounding global warming and the importance of being greener. If we can embed a greener mindset into an earlier generation, imagine where we could be now.
I believe I was seven when I got my first computer. It was an eMachines something or another with a Pentium processor and a 4 gig hard drive. I was stoked. So my father and I unbox it, wire everything together, and I stare at the monitor expectantly. I'm so excited I don't look away. My father tells me it won't turn on - I'm still for the most part a noob at this point so I just turn to him, go "hmm", and keep on staring at that monitor. After about ten minutes I finally look over at him - he's pushing the eject button on the disc drive, trying to turn the computer on. Nevermind the large green button in the center with the power symbol on it, no lets push the small beige button in the corner.
The Burning Bed. Farrah Fawcett drugs, then burns her abusive husband alive in their house. Cannot see the distaff version getting green-lit.
Now I regret not getting my photolab training done. Also, I should have worked for Walgreens instead of CVS. Sounds like the place to be a photolab tech.
I got to this point and expected a green screen story...
They forget that green means go
Was a nurse in Iraq, friends of mine get together and tell war stories, look over a friends that weren't there are turning green.
Start doing simple questions like what are the first x number of triangle numbers, primes, Fibonacci etc.. Build this up to more difficult questions like overlaying images using green screen. I'll let you know.

I'm fairly certain it was a green flame.
People who text or use cellphones while driving. Even when they are stopped at intersections it's dangerous especially for us pedestrians because they're just glacing up at the light and then floor it when the see green, but don't understand that they need to yield to a crosssing person on foot. It's just careless and inconsiderate that could result in paralyzing someone or the loss of life.

Everybody always talks about how lonely they feel when relationship posts crop up. Things like this always make me happy that I'm single and can spend all evening playing with friends in Overwatch and nobody will interrupt that. Grass is always greener etc, but sometimes it's nice to be reminded that not everybody has grass.
The Army... well at least I'm a somewhat socially acceptable awkward now. Sometimes I yell out odd Army slang/sayings like... "It's hotter than two rats fucking in a wool sock." Instead of just saying it's hot. Or "check fire!" When someone puts words in my mouth. "Beat your face." When someone is being stupid. "Got fucked by the green weenie." &lt;---- said this during an H&amp;R Block appointment when I got less than I thought I would. People look at me like I'm a asshole and I can't really disagree.

Udon, 2.99 usd for a 3 pack, only 60 mg of sodium per serving (way lot less than ramen). Just add some chopped mushrooms, green onions, broccoli and you are set. Only takes 10 minutes for it to heat up.
[The green flash.](http://imgur.com/hjUvauk)
That's also why it's so difficult to pass a lot of progressive laws like national healthcare, green initiatives, and such. People care about themselves only.
Well remember that the green weenie is always watching you, waiting for you to make one little mistake. You're never alone.
Hit meats first (steak, pork chops, bacon) then the macaroni salad, then the grilled green beans, brussels sprouts, or artichoke hearts, finish off with olives. Stay away from breads and pastries, they're usually poor quality and not really worth it except maybe some plain toast, kinda hard to fuck that up. Leave room for jello, but get it in the second lap so it doesn't start to melt into your meat and veggies. You'll be kicking yourself if you don't.
I dunno Yoda, are you? ARE YOU? *:green_stuff_all_over:*
Yeah, just like green text the more you just accept that none of them are real, they better they get. People eventually start making even more grandiose stories that just makes it better and better.

Tom Sawyer - their evergreen easy-entry song that many people are familiar with, highlighting what makes them popular 2112 - their long-form epic song that I consider their Stairway to Heaven, and the quintessential song that captures their early sound and style of song-writing Far Cry - from their 2007 album, gives a taste of their more up-to-date modern hard rock sound that gives a flavor for their more recent albums
Assorted spices kept in zip-lock backs in a fairly official looking briefcase. Long story short, I hate going out to eat, but for my old job is was a very necessary thing for potential clients. I have a very picky palette and a mild OCD when it comes to it, but I love all food. But things have to be \*very\* flavorful. And I mean \*\*very\*\*. I need more seasonings, more spices, all the time. Carrying shakers was too bulky, and much too obvious. Being a former cook, I usually knew which combination of spices were good with different dishes, so I'd discretely go in my case looking like I was shuffling through papers while I found the right combination for myself, palm it, then add it too my food when the client(s) wasn't looking. Got caught once, nearly detained, until the officer distinctly recognized one of the bags was actually processed MSG (looks like small, tubular salt), and then proceeded to recognize the rest of it (i had different kinds of sugars, salts, and "green" seasonings that looked an awful lot like ground weed). He laughed too hard for me to feel anything but annoyance at this point. Then he told me his wife does something similar. His wife, who was apparently part of my support group online.
I barely remember it but it had something to do with green goo. That's it.
Avocados, fuck avocados and everything made from them. They literally make everything worse, with their nasty slimy greenness. STOP PUTTING AVOCADOS IN SHIT!
I work at the green competitor part-time, and the sheer number of complaints we hear from customers about them is insane. I work there maybe 5 days a month, and still catch a few complainers in that short period of time.
Sun bleaching. My sister goes blond for a bit when summer hits and then she starts swimming a lot and her hair turns a bit green... (algae)
Artery clogging cauliflower and it's delicious. Fry up a package of bacon till crispy, crumble bacon up on a paper towel. Fry up the cauliflower in the bacon fat, sprinkle some breadcrumbs in, chop up some green onions and toss them in along with the crumbled bacon. During the holidays all of my family makes sure to tell me to make it.

IMO to me the biggest sign of "green flags" that give me an indication that someone is a keeper as a friend or otherwise is by the way they reciprocate effort and show actual care about your well-being. Relationships aren't one way streets. You shouldn't expect someone to be your friend/partner if all you do is give and get nothing or nearly nothing back. That's not* how real relationships work. If you want to receive you have to give. Period. Real friends/partners will happily give you a slap on the face to set you straight or sit down and have that talk with you if that's what needs to happen for you to realize your mistakes. I get it, none of us are perfect and we all make mistakes but I'll be damned if I let one of my friends do something really stupid that they'll regret for a long time. Edit: spelling
there has to be life somewhere, though i kinda doubt it's little green men with spaceships capable of light-speed travel that carry phasers ;)
I imagine it's hard to be a punk in the military. Do the undercut rules apply to guys as well? I know the first thing my old neighbor did after getting out of the military was dye his smattering of hair bright green.
tl'dr: Screw the updates. Screw every single one of them separately and forever. And screw you for saying something like "You did this to yourself" for the audacity to refuse to eat the first plate of green eggs and ham.

Add the word 'serious' in brackets on either side of your post (left is the most common). You don't need to use the fancy green button on the desktop version of the site (that's all it does).
I always get my groceries in paper bags and I make sure baguettes and carrots with the green tops still attached are poking over the top of the bag.
I personally like three The green mile. Independence day. And avengers endgame. I feel like these three movies you really cant go wrong with them.
Might be a little late in here, but: Traffic lights on the other side of the road. Being from Germany, this is just fucking amazing. Here we have the traffic lights right next to your car, which makes you sit very awkwardly in your car, waiting for it to turn green.
Unfortunately, The All Guardsman Party is greentext and hosted as pics...
When I make enchiladas I make my own sauce with sour cream, cilantro, jalapenos and green chile sauce. I always have a bunch left over when I'm done because I'm a noob and I don't know how to decrease the portions without screwing up the taste. I use that sauce on just about everything afterwards, my favorite being pizza because it's delicious. Other than that I used to have Everything bagels with peanut butter and sliced avocado on top. My roommate thought the addition of avocado was wierd.
What's green and has wheels? Grass. I lied about the wheels.
Most people are pretty good when they send a mail. It's when we appear in threads that they don't like us. They see green, they get mean.
Just swap out the soda for green tea or mate, at least at first. It makes a great daily drink with no negative side effects.
There's a nice vegan place up the street from me. They started delivering and I wanted to try out their pizza and the ostensibly nice side salad that came with it. For a price of 10.99 it seemed like it would be a good deal, right? The delivery guy dropped off a little paperboard box and inside it was a teeny tiny little slice of pizza, much smaller than what you'd expect if you were ordering pizza from a foodcart or pizza-by-the-slice place. It took me a moment to figure out where the side salad was because it was the little individual leafs of greenery toppled all over the tiny pizza. They didn't even put the salad in its own little container and the vinaigrette was all over the inside of the box and the tiny slice of pizza! Figures. Definitely not worth the price.
Little green ghouls, buddy!
Very short hair is even more uncomfortable than simply not shaving though. I personally support the idea of the safety razor. I've never had a better shave in my life, it's less wasteful(more "green"), plus it makes you feel like a man.
Buried? Think more like "soylent green".

In French, limes are called green lemons.
You wait TILL it turns green??
I'm surprised the priority lights (blinking green lights) don't exist anywhere else.
If you ever do, get one that's very green and just a little soft. It shouldn't be hard and the texture shouldn't be grainy. It should be soft and sweet and juicy and now I have to go get a pear to eat.
Clams and green olives. Just try it.
Leafy greens are useful because they are low in calories and take up space. Foods high in fiber are useful, too, because they can help you to feel fuller for longer.
Cauliflower Brussel sprouts String beans My mother would boil them till they were mush and call them vegetables. Grew up, started roasting them, I add garlic and oil to the brussel sprouts and green beans. Now I can't get enough of them!
I wish I could follow this more, but for some reason lying just comes so automatically. I'd never lie with the intention of hurting someone, or maliciously (except maybe a prank, but that's hardly malicious), but for trivial things sometimes I can't help myself. Over the years it's developed into a refined way of avoiding telling the truth or bending it slightly, rather than straight up lying. I don't have any deep secrets, but if you asked me what car I drive (I don't have a license), I'd tell you a green Subaru outback. If you asked me how I got it, I'd tell you the most interesting story I knew about how someone got their car. I'd rather entertain people than tell them the truth.
But not a real green dress that's cruel
Yeah it can be crazy. Sometimes traffic stops with a green light just because one person tries to split traffic and then about 50 other people follow suit and the cars have to stop. Still surprised I've never seen someone get hit by a car yet.
The interesting thing about that is that it was directed by Ang Lee. The next movie he did was Brokeback mountain, "lust, caution", and life of pi. All have amazing reputations....except for that shitty green movie.
Eh. We definitely have a shortage of physicians and judging by how often a visa question comes up, I'm inferring that we could do to keep more engineers. It's just poor policy. Every grad degree should come with a green card if not citizenship on offer. The labor market will clear at the right price and we'll have more skilled individuals like yourself to throw onto projects like getting companies off windows xp. Those projects will be cheaper, we'll collect the income tax and everyone will be better off. Unfortunately, the Dems have tied high skill migration reform with low skill amnesty. All in all probably sensible but in the meanwhile we're losing out.
12 spicy italian on ~~parmesan oregano~~ sigh, herbs and cheese. Regular cheese. No, not toasted. Lettuce, tomato, onion, spinach, green pepper. Pickles. More pickles. More pickles. Green olives. More olives. Three jalapenos. And sub sauce. No, just keep going. More. Keep going. Listen... I want you to put on a near irresponsible amount of sub sauce. Like as in your boss would get angry for how much sub sauce. _But sir, its running off the sandwich and onto the floor_ Ok, thats enough.
"Sometimes, I turn into a big, green monster and smash stuff."
fuck these people too. They also cause traffic. When a light turns green they just sit there and keep on texting. Selfish.
Salad and green beans.
I'd say sneezing into the inside of your shirt (like right where your chest is), is much more hygienic. Plus if a little green snot decides to peek out of your nose, you can wipe it into the shirt without anyone noticing instead of having snot on your sleeve.
Greenpeace has tons of opposition, and yes in factcommunism IS defined by the actions and character of communist nations and trying to defend communism is like trying to defend eugenics or segregation at this point. You basically just made my point for me with those two examples... the former because it shows the difference between feminism and a group like greenpeace and the latter because it shows how unreasonably far you need to go to defend feminism.
A green beret team.
You conveniently failed to read the line immediately before your quote.  ***He was already in bed with her***, and she was being flirty while they were touching feet. If that's not a green light to go for more, I don't know what is. There is one moment which might *possibly* be questionable. When he tried to kiss her she squirmed away. That's fucking confusing! She had been throwing all kinds of signals, and now she's turned away. But she didn't say "No" or "Stop", so he did what any normal human male would do when he thinks he's about to get some. He tried again. *To kiss her.* He didn't rip off her clothes. He didn't insert any part of himself into her. He thought he had the green light so he touched her and tried to kiss her. This is called "making a move". He didn't assault her. He didn't rape her. He didn't hurt her in the tiniest way. He tried to kiss her. She freaked out. He stopped. To lump this guy in with rapists is FUCKED UP. I don't understand how people like you expect human beings to function. With a small number of exceptions, men are expected to make the move. Women want us to. If we didn't initiate, the human race would die off. Ok, maybe that's an exaggeration, but how many women do you know want their guy to stop and ask "Can I touch you now? Do you want me to kiss you now?" Romance would be dead. Women would hate it if guys had to do this.
Ditch the pit road speed limit in auto racing as long as the green flag is still out.

I was sick with a cold and couldn't stop sneezing, I was only 12 and in my living room and a big one came on, as I tilted my head back I launched a huge green blob of mucous at ceiling. Grabbed a ladder and some paper towels and cleaned it as best as I could but there was still a stain. Dad comes home, goes about his routine and notices the stain. Confronts me and accuses me of throwing a tea bag at the ceiling (I had just finished a cup of tea with honey). Tried explaining that it was boogers but nope he wouldn't believe me and punished me to stay in my room for the rest of the week. This was in the 70's, no internet, games, TV, or books (they took them away). So yea a booger.
I feel like (south) Germany is very conservative in many regards, despite being very green etc. (some of it is stupid... like completely stop nuclear energy, while buying nuclear electricity from France). Northern Germany is a lot more progressive and 'avantgardiste'. Gay rights is one of those things, because south Germany is very catholic. (whereas most of the rest of Germany isn't) Maybe it's just a feeling that I have, because I've lived in other countries before...

Back when I had parakeets, one of them decides to fly over and rest on my head. I thought it was just being cute, until I just feel a plop and touch my hair to find a tiny smashed swirl made out of green bird poop. I can now say that a bird pooped on my head, though.
I know. I was just saying the thought of actual green peanut better makes me shudder.

My friend knows someone in a band called "green piss gang". I don't know if they're still together, but their music was the closest thing to nails on a chalkboard that I've ever heard
I'd imagine it wouldn't have much of an effect though because they worked in conjunction with the local law enforcement. If it would have caused issues the cops wouldn't/shouldn't have gotten involved/greenlit it. I'd also expect dozens of lawyers checked and double checked everything since the studio could have opened itself up to lawsuit if they did anything that compromised an investigation.
Yep, it was basically a green light given to Hitler by the Austrian government to control his home country.

Grew up in NYC, we played block hide and seek. You could hide anywhere as long as you didn't leave the block or go into any buildings. I had a secret weapon, I had a rain poncho from boy scouts looked just like a green trashbag. All I had to do was sit next to some trash and nobody ever found me.

I was 6 years old. I really wanted to get this plastic shovel up a slide to the top, so I thought "Oh I know. I'll just push it up the slide." Well silly me couldn't push it up hard enough to actually get it to the top, and I was pushing it with the blade facing me. Well, the shovel came down and caught my toe and toe nail. It peeled the nail almost entirely off. It grew back and reattached but from then on it was raised off my nail-bed and green. I eventually got it removed because some shoes would put pressure on it and make my toe hurt. Much happier now that it's gone.

Well seasoned and roasted vegetables. Brussels sprouts, onions and sweet potatoes.... throw in fresh garlic, season with salt, pepper, curry powder, garam Masala, add some olive oil and balsamic. Throw in the oven on 425 for 30-40 min. You can serve that by itself or throw it into a spinach salad. Or you can steam some rice then throw rice and veggies into a skillet, add chili paste, olive oil and seasoning to make a sort of stir fry hybrid. Or roast spaghetti squash and make a homemade pasta sauce. Make a Mediterranean salad... chop onion tomato and cucumber. Add olive oil, salt, pepper, some lime juice, balsamic, and feta or goat cheese. Homemade salsa ... canned diced tomatoes with green Chiles. Add chopped onion and cilantro, garlic, lime juice, salt, pepper to taste Sweet potato casserole... boil yams then mash together with banana saut√©ed in butter. Or pineapple. Or both fruits. Add water, bourbon, maple syrup and simmer. Or throw in the oven on 350 for a while. Showing you can cook up tasty veggies is way more impressive than doing a meat dish, will be tastier, cheaper, and healthier. Plenty of possibilities. This shit is easy. You literally can‚Äôt go wrong with roasted vegetables. Just season them well - my secret weapons are curry powder, garam Masala, and balsamic. As well as onion and garlic
[Simple green](http://simplegreen.com/products/all-purpose-cleaner/), I can clean the rims of a car with it, take out grease stains in even the most delicate clothing, works great on cabinets, shower doors, just about everything. It's also cheap and not harmful to the environment or pets.
Tea. I have tried India tea, green tea, rice tea, fruit tea, and Chinese tea - and disliked them all. Am British, too.
Cauliflower. This isn't because I don't like vegetables either. I love broccoli. Will eat carrots and green beans. Peas are good. But Cauliflower is a no-go from me.
Depends on what you eat and how much. If you just eat something like meat and greens with a little bread, you'll thin. If you go and get big fried meals, you'll gain.
I'm blaming EA for not greenlighting a sequel, not for how Spore came out.
On the other hand, I've gotten honked at for sitting at a green left turn signal when the cross-traffic was so bad that there wasn't any room to complete the turn. What the fuck do they want me to do, block the entire intersection for a whole cycle while they're *still* stuck behind me?
The green mile
I had a string of bad luck earlier this year. I had lost my job, lost my cat, lost my cell phone, and had some issues with my car. Thankfully, I had a friend of mine who told me the pizza place he worked at was looking for delivery drivers, but that the manager was only there after six o'clock on weekdays. It was around seven o'clock when I decided to ride my bike and get some fresh air for the day (You can only mope around unemployed for so long...) I had just moved into downtown Houston from the suburbs and was enjoying the sights of this huge city at dusk. Eventually, I realized I was within a few blocks of the pizza place so I decided to head in to speak to the manager. I was about a block away when I see this guy walking erratically on the sidewalk. I veer off the sidewalk onto the grass to avoid him, but he then gets onto the grass directly in front of me and begins sprinting towards me with his palms up. I instinctively put my head down hoping my helmet will catch the blow, but he somehow ends up getting me square in the nose. I somehow manage to stay upright on my bike and he continues walking as if nothing happened. "What the fuck is wrong with you??" I yell at him as I'm wiping the fountain of blood gushing out of my nose. "Oh, sorry, man, did I get you?" "Of course you did, you (insert racial slurs here. Not proud of it, but I was pretty upset.)" "Aw, shit, sorry, man" He then proceeds to walk up to me with his hand out as if he wants to shake my hand. I'm seriously weirded out and I slowly back off. Soon after, he turns around and continues walking as erratically as before until he crosses the street and walks into an alley. I get to the pizza shop no more than two minutes after this occurs and walk up to the counter and ask if I can speak to the manager for a job...oh, and if I could possibly wash up first. The counter girl nervously laugh and leads me to the bathroom where I get myself cleaned up. As soon as I walk out, the manager and owner are talking to me, apologizing profusely and give me the job right there on the spot. They suggest I speak to a cop to file a report since they don't want homeless people scaring off or attacking their customers and so I do. The cop asks me for a description and, in addition to his physical details, I tell her he was wearing a neon green shirt. She thanks me, tells me they'll keep an eye out, and leaves. About three weeks later, I'm delivering to a hotel and it is pouring rain outside. Right out in the parking lot, I see the same homeless guy that attacked me wearing the same neon green shirt. He's walking that same erratic walk without a care in the world, as if it wasn't raining sideways. Immediately, I become livid and start to fantasize ways of getting back at him when I notice he hasn't any shoes on; just socks. I park and go into the lobby to wait for my customer when he comes in, and yells some nonsense at the check-in clerk before she hands him something and leaves soon thereafter. It's made obvious to me that he's not at all "okay" and he probably just roams around the city without any idea of what's going on around him. I'm leaving the hotel and as I'm driving away, I see a cop about two blocks down the road. It's here that I'm conflicted as to how I should proceed with this. Should I call the cop over to him and let him do whatever it is cops do with the clearly insane homeless or do I leave him be to a life on the streets with no one to take care of him but with the potential to hurt other innocent people? I kept on driving. I've got a good job now and things are much better than they were in the first half of the year, but from time to time, I think about him and wonder if he's still out there, or if he's ever hurt anyone else since then or if I made the completely wrong decision.
I used to hate this as a kid, but now its indespensible - gotta have something green and crunchy: lettuce, or my favourite: spinach. The spinach adds a bit of crunch, good vitamins, and its leafy folds holds more Frank's hot sauce and mayo, so it doesn't all squooosh out the sides when you bite in.
I play the game of: How fast can I release the clutch when the light turns green before the car refuses (is that the word?). Tbh I'm always so fucking slow at releasing the clutch but I do it because refusing and needing to tur the motor back on is even worse for people behind me. I need the practice.
I recently was on spacedicks when I found a video of a man who cut the circulation to his balls. He keeps a vlog for several days and shows the natural progression of his balls as they turn into a bluish green by day three. He talks in detail about how horrendous the smell is and then to my horror he takes out some scissors and for the next three minutes he cuts one of his balls off. Puss (or semen) oozes out and at the last second his right testicle pops out like a cherry. He breaths a sigh of relief, "phew, one down one to go". The video then ends.
An absolutely remarkable thing by hank green. Best kind of mindfuck
Australian. Seriously, I know 3 people who, in the course of their travels, ran into Australian girls and brought them back to Canada. I am under the impression that there are more Australians *not* in Australia than IN Australia. Cause they're all teaching english in Japan or something. I think its like a green-card ploy; they're just want in on the poutine and free healthcare.
Smoking. First few packs, *maybe* the first carton you'll be feeling like billy bad-ass. After that though... Biggest fucking money pit, time sink ever. Not to mention the stench. And it's hard as fucking hell to quit after you're in deep. Alternatively, mobile gaming. I got one of them green (MGS: Peace Walker) PSP 3000's a few years back when I was around 14 or so IIRC. I tried playing Little Big Planet for a few hours the other day, I lasted 45 minutes before my hands cramped like shit. I really don't know how the hell I managed to play it as often as I did, and still have usable hands.
Try MDMA...if that doesn't make him open up, nothing on this god's green Earth will.
Right... and the summer is hot, the winter is cold, and the spring is green. There's context for those seasons too.
I hear you, can't stand what is going on in South America, but honestly we have more trees planted on the planet than in any other time in history. Granted these are not real forests, they are man made and harvested regularly. They don't have the same complex ecosystems that old growth forests have. On a side note I visited Vermont a few times and couldn't get over how green everything was, it's literally trees everywhere. My son went to school there and told me that at one time the majority of the state was clear cut. The government stepped in and planted most of the trees we see there now.
my name isn't green
Just.... Needs more green text
Pineapple, ham, green olives
Spirit in the sky- Norman greenbaum
Every video game ever that has "realistic graphics". They age as well as cream cheese in a greenhouse and stay fresh about as long. Stylized/artistic/cartoonish graphics will still look fine a decade or more later but realistic graphics will look dated by the end of the year...
I couldn't eat biscuits for a year. Most people don't know the amount of bacon fat that goes into the green beans.
This was back in the early 80's, we had TRS 80's running a unix variant and I picked up the manuals and read them all. The teacher also helped me with my basic programming skills. That being said the principal didn't even have a computer, when I showed up with the green bar paper all neat and stuff along with a printout of my program she called my computer teacher. They met, my teacher explained that I had an aptitude for computers and loved to read all the books she had. Principal made me spend my free periods helping out in the computer room (much better than staring at the walls in the cafeteria or library). Basically she saw it as initiative instead of an easy way out, I've always been lazy and if there is an easier way to get the same results I seem to always find it. 30 years later and I'm an operations manager for one of the largest healthcare systems on the east coast. It worked out pretty good.
Baked with salt, butter and garlic they rock! Boiled they are pretty gross green scrotums.
Peanut sauce, mix in whatever lunch meat I have on hand (unless there's some leftover chicken or something). Usually some green onions and garlic, too. I end up having turkey ramen a lot.
We should really ban that shit. It's a major cause of the greenhouse effect and a byproduct of creating Styrofoam.
Pistachio butter is green.
I and my ex-girlfriend went to the movies to see, *Thor: The Dark World*. When we got picked up, it was her father that picked us up. He was visibly upset and she wrote on an magazine, "I think he found the pregnancy tests." She disposed of the used one's and for some fucking reason, forgot to dispose on the non-used ones. So we get home and we're questioned and I told her to let me handle this as I'm good at manipulating people. As we're being questioned I put on an calm demeanor and "*under the pressure*" I start to "*crack*." So eventually I turn to my girlfriend and say, "I'm sorry." and turned to her mom to which my ex (who got the hint) said, "No!" I then turned back and said, "You're parents aren't stupid Indysteelers-ex. They know we're lying." I then turned back to her parents and said, "I would like to apologize to you and your husband for lying to both of you. It's an cowardly thing to do and not something that I'm proud of. The reason that we're both lying to you, although this still doesn't make it right, is because my sister is potentially pregnant. My sister's boyfriend parents watch them like a hawk so if they went and bought something and came home, they would wish to see the items they bought. So I stole some from Walgreens and we hid them, obviously not well, in Indysteelers-ex's room. I will admit, that I and Indysteelers-ex's did use a couple for just to use one. We shouldn't have lied and I apologize for that." Her mom then goes on to say that we could have came to her and blah blah blah. *Phew!!* I think that trying to lie about that to any parent who be awkward for anyone.
Chlorophyll is green.
You're very welcome. I do think that things have changed, but not in the last 10 years. I know it was easier in the 80s, for instance. But we've been at this since 2003 and got our green cards in 2013 and there were no significant changes during that time.
Genetic lottery. Probably need to inherit a "green" gen for both parents to get green eyes. Stuff like that.
Lets see some civil war in greenwich hell yeah!
An an oddly specific one. I was the computer operator (mainframe sysadmin in today's lexicon) for a company that rented medical equipment to hospitals. IV pumps, bassinets, etc. 180 branch offices around the US, over 300 line items in our inventory. Company had been in business for about 10 years. I get a phone call on a Saturday from my boss, the IT director. "Need you to write and run a report," he says. No biggie, this is part of my job. "I want every rental for every branch since day 1, sorted by account, by line item, then by date, then summarized by account and branch. Since Day 1, all locations. How long to run it and tail the report file, and how long to print it out?" There is only one reason in the world for wanting that specificity of data. "We're getting bought, aren't we?" I asked. "I didn't say that," he laughed, "but don't mention that to anyone!" Took about 19 hours to run and four DAYS to print. Used over 40 boxes of extra-wide fan-fold greenbar printer paper. Went through six ribbons. THEN we had to ship it all to New Jersey, where the buying company was. There were 350 people employed at HQ, where I worked. They kept six.
Agreed. I do the same thing! I love smokin' some green and spending the next hour giving my man the best blowjobs. It gets me hotter than hell immediately.
according to my dad when I was a kid I ate a green gouache and shat green for an entire week. I don't remember any of it... he called the intoxication hotline and they said it wasn't harmfull, so it was cool...
Finally I found another one. Can you help me write a letter to whoever decides what goes in sushi rolls and make him stop throwing the green shit in there?
Woah, the third one down. God damn. Mars Attacks, end of story. I was probably 7 or thereabouts, and for some reason the scene where they go to war and are just vaporized into green skeletons shocked me so much that I ran out of my friend's house, down the street, and back to my own house. Then, after they coerced me to come back, I ran out again (for good), when they revealed the chicuaua with the human head. My brain doesn't like body morphia, not one bit.
To be as cool as the green lantern
I had one where I was a green skinned monster sinewy monster with my normal facial features and hair. I had long foot long boney talons on each of my digits and my lungs existed outside by chest just hanging beneath my chin. I also was disturbingly strong. I was wandering around a low poly ravine like something out The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. Where I met an old times green skinned, boil nosed witched stirring something in her cauldron. Eh that is about all I remember it was obviously long ago before I could dream in higher resolution.
Start with complete internal organ replacement. All internal systems including circulatory, respiratory, digestive, endo/exocrine, the whole shebangabang. I'd pop for upgrades, too, everything to support enhanced functions down the road; for instance, upgraded muscles and bones will need upgraded circulatory and respiratory functions. So all the shit that keeps me alive is fully upgraded and replaceable. Now to get around better. That means bones strong enough to support upgraded muscles. So all of that, and innervation to support it. Finally, let's add some sensory bells and whistles. Enhanced sight in terms of acuity, spectral sensitivity, and maybe even some on-board motion tracking and pattern analysis. Which means some processing power. This means I'd need upgraded cooling and some power generation capabilities. So, new skin it is, to provide enhanced cooling and solar power/photosynthesis. No, I wouldn't be green. I'd keep my brain and reproductive organs, for obvious reasons. Other than that, basically what others have said: full cybernetic enhancement.   musculoskeletal-nervous overhaul. Upgrade bones, muscles and innervation.
The first one I ever played was a NES. It was my mother's and I used to go to town on Super Mario Bros., Excite Bike and Duck Hunt. I tried my hand at Legend of Zelda, The Adventure of Link and Metroid, but my feeble 3-year old self couldn't quite fathom their difficulty The first gaming device that was explicitly mine was a kelly green Game Boy Pocket, I think it was a Christmas gift when I was 5 or so. My first games for it were Super Mario Land 2 and Donkey Kong Land III. That was when I realised how big a part of my life video games would be.
Pretty sure he anyway said both were written and he's editing them down at his publisher's request. I don't think he plans to release WoW until both are green-lit in case he has to change more plot points.
I just race cars as a pedestrian. With a good lead off on the green light, I can usually do quite well, especially if they space out. The trick is to see how far you can get before they pass you.
Honking horns. It is a loud, alarming sound that makes every part of my automatic nervous system involuntarily go hot. It disturbs everyone within a quarter mile radius, usually for the purpose of getting the attention of a single person. It should only be used to prevent an accident. It should not be used to express anger, greetings, or frustration with the fact that my foot did not depress the accelerator pedal within a Planck unit of the traffic light turning green. The worst offenders are the people who give kids rides to school. In the age of cell phones, there are still people who will honk their horn at 6:30am in the middle of a residential neighborhood or apartment complex in order to inform a child that they have arrived at the exact fucking time they arrived yesterday, and the day before, and every God-damned day prior. And of course the child is never ready on time, so they must honk again. If you are responsible for taking a child to school in the morning and for whatever reason you cannot afford or otherwise make use of a mobile phone, then please get your lazy ass out of the fucking car, walk to the door, and knock on it like a civilized person. There are few things in life that make me angrier than this and nobody is doing anything to stop it.
Spicy Chinese style tofu is amazing. And cheaper than meat dishes. Spicy tofu with bok choi and greens is the best.
You're absolutely right. The problem is the completely unnecessary and arbitrary rules. My favorite is the whole pre-check thing. Most of the time I fly, they randomly select people from the normal line to go through pre-check\* to make the lines more evenly distributed. This basically confirms the whole shoes, jacket, laptop thing is bullshit. Another favorite is the last time I flew, I was randomly selected for additional screening. I stood there for 3-5 minutes waiting for the screener to come over. Then she wiped my hands with some wipe and put it in some little analysis machine, which gave the green light, and I was free to go. So unless I forgot to wash my hands after making a bomb, they weren't gonna find anything useful. At its heart, the x-rays and metal detectors certainly prevent weapons from getting through, but we had those before. Making me take my jacket off and confiscating my 3.5oz tube of toothpaste aren't doing shit. \*In case anyone is unaware, pre-check is a service you can pay for (or otherwise go through some signup process) that basically allows you to go through what is usually a shorter line, and when you get to the scanners you can leave your light jacket and shoes on, and you don't have to remove your laptop or your liquids bag.
I like to think of it as a perfect storm of circumstance. I was drunk enough to have the balls to dance. Sober enough to not stumble about. And smart enough to know that if they wanted my hands on them, they'd put them there themselves. Every other guy kept getting too handsy with them. They'd guide my hands to where they wanted them and I only ever moved them to spots they had already given the green light.
But not a real green dress, that's cruel.
Spain, a lot of beautiful green open areas all around.
My girlfriend is keeping those fucks in business, sorry everyone. We've got a whole container of cards she stocked up on at some point but whenever it's "birthday season" for our group of friends/family she inevitably comes back with a Hallmark bag and like $60 worth of fucking card stock paper with bullshit written in it that I have to sign. By the way don't ask her why she didn't use the cards in the fucking card box- those 'weren't the ones she wanted'. Jesus bloody christ babe it's 2018 unless you're gonna put money in the cards (please fucking don't they're made of fucking myrrh or mithril already) why would anyone send someone else a card in the mail? Send an email- the person can treasure it literally forever and it takes up zero physical space and costs nothing to anyone. Who likes getting mail anymore? It just makes me nervous- "oh shit somebody wants money from me" is all I ever think when I go check the mail. Even our friends' kids have tablets, send those little fuckers a message on Snapchat or something they'd love that shit. Plus- I dunno how you can claim to be 'green' if you're gonna literally send someone something that has to be driven, flown, and driven again to get to where it needs to be, is made of paper that's likely going to get tossed in the bin and not recycled, and has no tangible benefit besides sitting in someone's "I can't throw this away or I'd feel bad" box in their closet? Thanks. I needed to vent. I love my girlfriend she's a brilliant, beautiful, lovely woman.
I didn‚Äôt sleep at all last night, because I was reading journals of the green goblin!
Wwalgreens I think has just caught its first sniffle of what may be a deadly case of the flu. Every Walgreens around me has stopped its 24HR. operations and the one closest to me has dramatically decreased its staff size. Time will tell.
Fresh, cool, crisp, green grapes. I will eat as many grapes as your put in front of me.
I have avoided death way to many times for my age at 21 1. partial complex seizure whilst not likely to kill you it's possible. 2. Kid through a slab of concrete at my head in primary school 3. 4 suicide attempts (turns out im not good at suicide and end up getting help because of the pain i am alright now though) 4. Nearly run over in my town TWO times if it was not for my reflexes i would of been dead both times the walk across the street light was green and i looked right and left..... 5. I got mugged and bashed having my head beaten late at night whilst on a walk in town. 6. As a toddler i fell off a veranda hit my head on the side of it cracking it open and fell into a rose bush....nice scar now haha 7. Been attacked quite a bit in school due to severe bullying whilst unlikely to kill someone it's a possibility one hit to the head can kill. 8. nearly had a heart attack i think i got out of the bath collapsed onto the floor intense heart pain and i couldn't move i was paralysed all i could do was scream out to my Father.
I live in the South now, I don't think I have yet found a food that they won't deep fry. Some of my favorites: fried pickles, fried green tomatoes, fried turkey legs (some people even deep fry a whole turkey for thanksgiving, which is somewhat dangerous but also delicious), and fried macaroni and cheese.
Why isn't your name green?!
None of the food I've ever had at hooters was ever bad. If its upsetting your stomach, I'm suspecting that you've got IBS or something similar. On the other hand, twin peaks has some really terrible items on their menu. Chicken fried steak, and their green beans come to mind. I love both, and their examples are disappointing. Finally, you should try Ojos Locos. Similar concept, but the uniforms are much better... Menu includes similar items to hooters, but also tacos.
Is this that pale, greenish melon fruit? We call it spanspek in my country. That stuff is fucking vile. It tastes like Satan's soap.
It depends on the other toppings! I wouldn't throw Pineapple on a Buffalo Chicken pizza, for example, but ham &amp; green pepper go right along fine with pineapple.
*Being green*
Was it green?
Cabbage/Kale/Brussels sprouts/Broccoli/Cauliflower/kohlrabi/collard greens. You may think I'm listing too many vegetables, but *they're all the same plant!* Just different cultivars of *brassica oleracea*. It ain't right, I tell ya!
*Little green ghouls, dude!*
I've RES tagged you as Random Fact Lover! I've always loved going through the Guinness book of world records, but random fact books are so much more fun. Where else can you learn that Wintergreen life savers make a piezo electric spark when you crunch them in your mouth. If you stand in front of a mirror in the dark you can actually see the flash. Random facts are the best conversation starter. Take care.
Drinking, fights, green and potatoes.
Went to a Godfather's Pizza once where there was some nice green mold in the bottom of the Parmesan Cheese shakers... Never again.
Cheesy scalloped potatoes and green bean casserole with French onions. And definitely biscuits
Yeah animal manure is pretty op but it's readily available and if it wasn't you'd end up using green manure. If it wasn't for the meat and dairy industry animal manures prices would skyrocket.
I was a dumb ass and bought some Monster speaker cables. They were in every way worse than the cheap cables I bought from radio shack. First the end connectors frayed and then fell off (who knew that rubber could fray). Then the lovely clear insulation degraded and became sticky. Next the copper that should have been protected by the insulation corroded and turned green. After that they ended up in trash bin.
Did you lose your taste buds in a tragic frozen pole and/or scalding hot chocolate accident in your youth? Green apple skittles probably deserve 10-100x the hate they currently get. That's a conservative estimate. I sort my skittles before I eat them. I throw the green ones away. Nope, I don't offer them to someone else, I love humanity too much to do that to others. Green skittles, I hate you so much.
The warring was obviously started by the Arab states that invaded Israel on the day of it's declaration of independence. Then they lost and they want to pretend that they never lost. Your interpretation is 100% incorrect. Israel, for example, left Gaza and the Palestinian response was to complain that they left unilaterally, they destroyed greenhouses for food production left for them, then proceeded to smuggle in rockets to shoot randomly into Israel. Palestinians are like a little kids that start fights, get beat up, but continue to keep fighting, then complaining about getting beat up in the process. They're highly racist, they refuse any outreaches of peace, complain about living next to Jews, and use the justification that someone is Jewish as an excuse to kill them. They run multiple militant groups that glorify suicide bombing. They dig tunnels to attack and kidnap Israelis. Palestinians are completely to blame in this conflict. They are unwilling to compromise for peace.
Are you the one that puts the cup at the absolute WORST possible position on the green?
Nah man, they got this guy on a green screen https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSMRshlf_o
Well from what i have understood so far you need to 1. Take Viagra 2. Ride a dirt vike and land on your head 3. Have a stroke 4. Exhaust your rods and cones so you use other reseptors or some shit. 5. Or drink whisky and some green shot thing like i did.
I actually like corn in mine, but try green beans.
If it helps, we have the same issues in the UK: * Conservatives - will screw everyone over that isn't rich and dismantle the government support systems * Labour - couldn't balance a weighing-scale, let alone the national budget and will tell you they're helping the "common man" but actually just serve themselves whilst doing short-term fixes and screwing over future-you. * Liberal-Democrats (it took me a while to remember the name) - aren't sure who they want to be but after a small period of national interest have returned to "not being either of the other parties" and sitting between them in policy * Green party - have zero idea what they'd do other than green issues, with no understanding or care of how pushing green policies ad-ridiculum would flatten the economy * The racist parties - self-explanatory * Other parties - No clue.
As a US green card holder, the opposite is also true.
I was in bed sick with a cold and she came over demanding that I come to her house to spend time with her. I said I just wanted to rest. She said she'd break up with me if I didn't. This was the final straw for me. I asked her if she really meant it. She said she did. I said ok. 10 minutes later when wanted to get back together, I refused and stuck to it. I tried to walk away but she wouldn't let me. She was physically latched on to me and was flip flopping between screaming abuse and begging me to take her back. Eventually she threatened to kill herself if I didn't come back to her house with her. I didn't think she'd actually do it, but I did think she was unstable enough to injure herself out of spite, so I folded one last time and went. It was late by that point and she had exhausted herself so she went to sleep and I stayed on the couch. I got up early and left. I remember saying goodbye to her dogs and thinking that it was unfair to them that they'd never be able to see me again. Honestly, that was the hardest part. Over the next few days I took one phone call and responded to one message to say that, yes, we were really over. She demanded I meet her one more time to get my stuff, and I agreed to meet her in a Walgreens parking lot. Out she came, on a Tuesday afternoon in full "show him what he'll be missing" outfit. Makeup, done up hair, high heels and miniskirt. She tried really hard to pick one last fight, including climbing in my car so I wouldn't leave, but eventually she realized that I wasn't biting and that infuriated her and she stormed off, got in her car, and peeled out of the parking lot. Never heard from her again. I still wish those dogs all the best.
I love green everything, but not everything I love is green
Seriously? It's cold. My Filipino ex didn't expect that when she first saw it in-person. She ran out to it on the side the road like a little kid but then was horrified to find that it was freezing cold! There are many kinds of snow depending on the temperature and humidity when it falls. The texture, weight and stickiness change depending on that. We get enough snow that a mere snow shovel isn't efficient (3-5 hours to clear our drive) - so we use a [front loader](https://www.greenhillfarms.net/wp-content/uploads/IMG_63191.jpg) to clear it. Takes about 10 minutes.
Evergreen gum is called pine tar. You're thinking of wintergreen, also known as methyl salicylate, which is used to give a minty flavor to gum and chewing tobacco. Evergreen trees used to be called wintergreens, so that might be how you got it mixed up.
I watch a lot of your comedy TV.  You're green aren't you.  Just stop, nobody thinks it's funny or witty.
Spaghetti. It ain't fancy, but it's quick and you can pimp out the sauce. And it's either that or hamburger patties and green beans.
I wouldn't be chewing on green water if i was u
Can't remember. I think it was near a walgreens.
British Columbia is the land of the pedestrian controlled crosswalk. If you don't push the button, the cross-traffic's light will stay green. If you are in the passenger seat in Vancouver, one of your duties is getting out and hitting the cross-walk button so that your driver can actually get you guys across the street. If you drive alone, that's when you pull [this maneuver](http://i.imgur.com/WQdec.jpg)
On my 18th bday, I was sitting outside with my best friend while waiting on our buddy to come and pick us up to go party. We both looked up when a meteorite streaked across the sky lighting up the ground a bright green. We sat there in amazement for a few moments, then my best friend looked over at me and said "Happy Birthday, Brother."
You know, as silly as this sounds, this genuinely does seem like it could be quite a reflective and enlightening experience. Hell, you could even go alone without fear of judgement, because who the fuck knows the random green guy? *You could start turning up at all your local clubs and festivals, and become a "thing"!*
I stopped preferring Oops! All Berries! when I ate half a box in one night and shat green for a week.
So here in the UK we have a law that says radio and television broadcasters must present news in this way, showing no overall bias to any side. The problem is with something like Brexit, where all the reasonable parties had a indifference at worst but usual objection and one mad UKIP boi was for it. Nigel Farage got so much air time on the radio that this fringe idea basically became a main source of contention and look where we are now. There is the equal weighting fallacy, like climate change deniers get the benefit of as well (scientists say yeah, we've measure the global climate is warming and it's to do with greenhouse gases but the loonies go that's an opinion and now our world is flooding, thanks guys). On the other hand newspapers here get to print literal lies as headlines so long as the next week they put an apology on page 18. So... it's not great all round.
If the light turns green and your in the middle of the road do a little jog until you cross
Sitting in a lecture theatre with 200+ students, pin-drop silence. Out of nowhere one of the beijing exchange students sitting near the front initiates one of the loudest mucus snorts I think I've ever heard - you know, the one right before you hock a green one. Pretty much the entire class bursts up in laughter, and this dude is just sitting there wondering why everyone is laughing. Lecturer was jovial about it the first time. The guy pulled another one not long after and was told quite fervently to STFU or GTFO.
Isn't it outweighed by the surpluses you make on bills though? Just for $1 you have $0.95 in surplus value, and that only increases with higher valued bills. For the full range of coins and bills produced, surely we're in net surplus just on the base value of the currency. Per your numbers, there are around 15 million pennies produced per year. If it costs $1.66 in materials to produce 100 pennies, then that's around $249,000 to produce 15 mil pennies. Those 15 mil pennies have a base value of $150,000, putting us at a deficit of $99,000. Keeping in mind that a single dollar yields a surplus of $0.95, you would eliminate the deficit by producing about 105,000 $1 bills, which is a generous fraction of the number of pennies produced, so I think it's realistic to assume we *do* produce many more than that. Just looking at $100 bills, which yield a surplus of $99.86 per bill, we would need to produce around just 2,500 $100 bills to put us back into net surplus. I doubt there's a significant enough difference in the other non-material costs between each of the coins to change these calculations all that much. Plenty of businesses produce certain products at a loss because they have other more profitable products that compensate for the losses. Those less profitable products could have a lot of intangible benefits as well. For instance, consider a movie studio that regularly puts out massively profitable blockbusters, but which also occasionally greenlights risky movies that likely won't sell all that well, but are passion-projects that do something new or interesting and genuinely contribute to the artform. Those smaller movies would lead to a loss, but they may be very well reviewed and earn the studio a lot of goodwill from hardcore moviegoers, who may be more likely to support the studio's high-profile movies in the future.
Holiday by green day just something about it
Soda. A fountain drink costs pennies to pour, and you can charge a couple of bucks for it. Most side items, fries, macaroni and cheese, green beans etc, are cheap to make in bulk as well. The big ticket items, like steaks and ribs are usually priced as low as possible.
...wow, Hulk could get all the green babes.
Nah I like to learn, chill man that's why I said no snark because it sounds like a snarky comment but I'm just out here wanting to know what rabbits eat Edit: "During warmer seasons, rabbits will eat¬†weeds,¬†grasses, clover, wildflowers, and flower and¬†vegetable plants. When the weather turns cold, rabbits will munch on¬†twigs, buds, bark, conifer needles, and any remaining greenplants."
I used to live in a tea-growing region of Japan. But, you don't need that experience to know that green tea leaves are processed. Green tea is not made by simply picking leaves off the plant and throwing them into a bag as OP described. After harvesting, the leaves are steamed, rolled, and dried.
Oh I'm sure if I lived in America I'd probably have a greater appreciation for the architecture of Oxford (I've lived near Oxford all my life and currently work for the University). Just like how I live in England and love the huge pillar of glass skycrapers they have there in places like New York. The grass is always greener I guess.
I like the green (apple) when they're by themselves (might even bee my favorite) but with any other skittle at all my mouth is like "why".
I imagine there's a huge range of normal. It depends a lot on what you focus on. There are things I wish were different, but I don't obsess about them so I'm generally fairly satisfied. In my experience, the grass can always seem greener on the other side, no matter where you are.
Hitting every green light on the way to work and then back home.
I don't know if it's the same but once I spent 5-6 minutes waiting for a stop sign to turn green.
Yeah sorry to break the news. Canada is just a green screen room in northern Mexici and y'all are paid actors
Get a bag of beans and a bag of rice, that's probably $6 or so. With the $4 I have left I'd buy a huge bag of greens. Either collard greens or kale. Would be an insanely boring menu for the week but I'd survive, lol.
I too am from Ohio, and I've used those hedge apple things around my house and that seems to help. Those green brainy looking ball things you see everywhere. Other people swear they work as well, but maybe it's all placebo effect.
See, that's 100% the issue though with Nuclear. Fuck being PC, let's be real here: countries like China and India are almost undoubtedly NOT going to adhere to strict laws about storage and disposal, to save money. Even in the West, you think recycling right now is totally legit and done the best way for all of us? Nah, best for profit. Fuck it, just ship it to China and have them fill their landfills. Costs way less than proper disposal and recycling. Corporations don't give a shit morally, whatever saves them money is what matters. Then you have to consider public stupidity and ignorance over Nuclear in general (can't even build wind farms due to people worrying about their house price due to a view being spoiled, yet they demand greener energy...), and it becoming an easy target for "oh god we're all fucked by radiation" terrorism or targeted attacks etc.
Probably Grown-Ups. There is no goddamn way that fucking pile of shit had a script to it. You know they went to the studio, said who was all going to be in it to a brain dead executive, and it was green lit. If you watch it again you will see I am right. Also, fuck Batman Forever! I knew when I saw that movie in a theater when I was 7 that movie was going to suck by just listening to the opening music.
was thinking us greenies were more light sensitive too
We miss you too, sugar. You gotta get yourself down here for a visit. We'll get you some fried green tomatoes, boiled peanuts, and some sweet iced tea.
nice man. and nice jeep :) Would be amusing if it was limey /bright (Acsii?) green in south florida. cause if it was then i've seen yah lol. and warnglers are nice. and really? gas guzzler? thats like what. 20 or so mpg for you?  My baby gets 10.....haha...hahahaha.....  Oh and she cost me $180 something bucks in texas to fill up once when traveling. averages around 75 in south FL. damn amazing....(curse this 32 galloon tank)  and company van. now THAT is a win right there. no worry for gas! use the company CC! lmao.
Yeah, and those green rectangular things are a bearer instrument, so if you lose them or they get stolen, they're gone. Also, they have a fixed value, so if you rely on them, you might not have enough. Keeping one or two blank checks in your wallet, just in case, is a sensible hedge.
We're reliant on guys having the guts to ask women out, when we're apparently overwhelmingly unable to pick up women's signals and green lights for advancements. How...the fuck have we got this far?
He played an alien. Martian, green makeup, the works. Hilariously embarassing for school aged me. Mind you, back then it was Kentucky Fried Chicken and it wasn't shit.
I work for a geophysics company. A lot of the jobs in my field/related to my field send you all over the world, and some don't require much if any education or experience. Mining, drilling, core logging, geologic field helper, geophysical technician, drill pad builder, etc. Most of the sites I work on are fairly remote, but I've been all over north america in some really picturesque forests, tundras, mountains, deserts, and valleys. I have coworkers who have worked all over africa, australia, europe, greenland, and south america. I usually stay in hotels, but on really remote jobs, there's usually some temporary structures set up for living quarters. In those situations there are also construction workers, cooks, cleaners, office assistants, medics and lots of other duties if you aren't into looking at rocks.
When people don't accelerate that much when the light turns green. People like to be able to get through the light.
Who the fuck greenlit this at the station, they should be in prison.
I'm a bird waiting to get shot on to some green pigs.
I miscalculated the acceptable amount of space to leave when I stopped in the first place, and am closing it. Also, it's an act you can take that helps appease your anticipation. "It will be turning green soon. Just a few more seconds. Here, we're basically already going," you think to yourself, inching forward.
I used to think that every generation is more accepting and less racist than the last. I look at places like Evergreen college, and I start to doubt that.
In the UK, more land is taken up by golf courses than actual concrete structures. A slight change in legislation would release 3% of green belt to construction, which we barely build on now anyway. We need to be realistic and build more APPROPRIATE housing, not just more housing. Also, build up, not out. New houses are smaller than the ones from the 70s, yet have just as many rooms, because people value 3 beds over 2, yet the houses are blatantly just 2 beds in size. A disgusting practice to keep house values up.
Frozen green beans are the fucking worst amigo
A lot of people are proud of their green cards
Shrek, like who the fuck would wanna watch ugly green orc
Go to walgreens raid medical supllies, then go to home depot and get as much supplies as i can, board up all the windows in my house and reinforce my cars and deck them out with zombie killing things
Yup, when I was 19 I was walking home from seeing a friend, I took a shortcut through a field. There was nobody else around and suddenly a mug just fell and landed in front of me. It was green with a weird pattern on it, I actually stopped to look around and there wasn't another person anywhere. I've always wanted to know what the fuck happened and where that mug came from.
If you are anything other than first in line you wouldn't be increasing time since putting the car in gear takes less time than waiting for the car(s) in front of you to go. If you are first in line then you should be paying attention to the cross lights to anticipate when your light will turn green. If you are first in line and can't see the cross lights, then and only then would I leave the car in gear. It's very easy to get lazy and not hold the clutch down all the way. Letting it out a little bit can cause friction on the gears and result in unnecessary wear on the clutch. Putting it in neutral at stop lights is the proper technique.
I have done *similar* things but never got caught. I used to make myself some weed tea every single day. I would make a tincture of THC and make some green tea and add some of the bud to the tea bag for flavor. It worked very well for weeks until a friend of mine accidentally bumped into my desk and it spilled it all over the carpet. My teacher walked over and asked me what kind of tea it was because it smelled very unique. He was kind of oblivious and I think was actually curious. A girl near me who knew what I was up to, without missing a beat, told him it was 'Jamaican Buck Buck Tea.' What a mess.
A green light at an intersection means it is *legal* to go, not that it is *safe* to go.
It's not the publishers' fault OP had a terrible idea, and the publisher who had to greenlight it thought it wouldn't LITERALLY be a book talking about Youtube videos people had to see, not elaborate stories about them...
I mean apparently green paint isn't good for dining rooms I heard once
Point a green laser pointer at their eyes
Fresh cabbage, fresh chicken breast, fresh broccoli, fresh green beans, fresh milk. All I would have to buy is Rice and cereal and I would be fine for life.
And let's NOT forget, there are actually TONS of places where you can get thin crust(less often called 'cracker' crust, or 'tavern style', and it often but not always has cornmeal on the bottom of the pizza) pizza in Chicago. It's a myth we're all about deep dish, and to be honest there are TONS of great thin crust pizza at! The list goes on and on of good such thin crust pizza places one can go to, in the Chicago area. I.e. Candlelite in West Rogers Park/West Ridge(as people interchangeably use both names for this neighborhood), Pat's Pizza on Lincoln Ave in Lincoln Park, Piece Pizzeria in Wicker Park, Vito and Nick's in Ashburn(southwest side), Roseangelina's in Evergreen Park, IL, any Barnaby's location in the suburbs(Niles, IL, Des Plaines, and more locations, heck they even have one in South Bend, IN!), I could go on forever with mentioning great thin crust places could go on and on throughout the city and suburbs!
The green mile
Not so much a problem but my dad had some absurdly rich elderly-ish friends when I was young who had a huge greenhouse on their land full of exotic plants, including a few marijuna plants. Apparently they had no idea what they were but thought they looked good. Being a somewhat conservative couple once my dad realised and Elaine's to them what they were growing they were mortified, destroyed all trace of the evidence and spent the next few weeks fretting that they were goi to prison.
The Green Gas All of your farts will have a slight green tinge to them so that everyone who smelt it is fully aware of who actually dealt it.
Italian BMT on Hearty Italian bread. Lettuce, sweetcorn, onions, green peppers, sometimes gherkins, sweet onion sauce. One slice of cheese on each half (don't like too much cheese), and most often toasted.
That as long as our society uses personal profit as the prime motivator for any decision, we will keep wasting so much human capital and our international economy will remain void of humanity. Humanity is strong through cooperation, we should nurture that. Not abuse it. I will never sign off on personal gain through the abuse of others, be it external or internal. One of the reasons why I always vote for "green" parties. It's important that we make balanced decisions and take into account all possible scenarios instead of always opting for the most profitable option. Most political parties will rarely put health, climate or moral concerns ahead of short-term economical beneficial ones, even when public opinion is clearly against it.
A green light. I was like "whoooaaaa man!"
Holy shit I currently work there. My bank account statement is probably 50% Walgreens transactions. So I've been loading money on a Walgreens gift card and only using that for Walgreens purchases.
I once knew a girl with the most amazing dark emerald green eyes. Had never seen anything like it before or since.
Yeah I know and it would be great; but no one would greenlight that since it wouldn't be profitable.
I hate students and hippies. However, I'm taking an online course which entitles me to be legally classed as a student and I'm a huge supporter of Greenpeace and green technologies. Edit: I also hate children and the idea of them, yet, I'm a parent.

And this angry green monster is on a team of super heroes. This stuff pretty much writes itself.
Also, the sky turns lime green.
Video Editing &amp; how to do complicated effects easily such as a green screen dragon attacking a parking lot
Well, besides the obvious answer of Legos, I'd have to go with army men. I don't want to know how many hours I spent building forts and trenches for battalions of the little green guys, only to walk back a few paces and mortar the fuck out of them with rocks.
I admire their honesty. They *look* like little green bags of goo, and sure enough that's exactly what they are. Hideous flavor and possibly the worst mouth feel of any vegetable ever. Like a mouthful of large bug eyes.
Well yes, but come here and you'll see what I mean. When you have a left turn lane and the light turns green and the cars file out into the intersection, you will often end up with one lane going to a small cluster of cars three lanes wide, and as soon as we get the clearing arrow or there is space, everyone files back down to one lane. It's just a matter of maximising the space in the intersection so as many cars as possible get to turn. We also have 3-4 lane roundabouts with no markings, for example, people kind of just make their own lanes. Even crazier is France and Italy though.
My date and I sit and drink green, monster titty milk on a remote island.
Start with the basics this year, tomatoes and green peppers. See how that goes. Lettuce is easy to grow and can be grown in stages so You have it all summer. You can grow potatoes in a barrel or large planter, this works well because when they are ready you can just dump the thing over instead of trying to dig them out. Are you canning or dehydrating any of this stuff?
It's a drink/family of drinks, but... Alcohol. I live in college dorms, and, even though my entire residence hall are freshman, everyone gets drunk every Thursday-Sunday. I just can't get why people stomach it. It reeks, and not in the good pungeance of saurkraut. One guy came up to me tonight and basically said, "Sure, it tastes like shit, but it gets better the more you drink." No thanks, I'll stick with my green tea citrus.
where from? i just bout 12 for like 20 bucks at walgreens
My mother told me the same thing. I actually thought it's true I mean they are smaller and they are green so they look unripe. You learn everyday something new.
I play it on and off. I have more fun watching videos of it to be honest. The more annoying part is how many people are trying to copy it now. Like h1z1 and that mine craft unity asset pack that constantly appears on steam green light and Jim sterling rants about it. I think it's been called unturned, unitz, day survival begins and who knows what else.
Took a break from my longtime girlfriend to sleep around and party because i thought the grass would be greener on the other side. It both was and wasn't. It clarified a lot about who i was and how i felt about my partner. It lasted 1 year, we both had fun and eventually found our way back to eachother and are now married with 2 kids. Wouldn't have it any other way now. No ragrets right?
I like mixed greens because I'm trying to provide ample nutrients to my body
Locusts, the green huge ones to be more specific. Not sure what it is about them, no problem with other bugs or spiders or reptiles. Even learned to kill them from a distance by throwing stuff at them rather then going in at close range for the kill. If one jumps on my face I'd probably blow a fortune on psychiatrists.
The greens don't have a real plan for a lot of issues. I feel like they're like the company that gets one job done - in their cased it would be some kind of environmental project - and then go "well shit ... ... ... Now what?" :/
Why does this have to be the case though? Perhaps: She is cheating on another guy WITH him. It's the "real" relationship that sparks the jealousy, because he is aware of its existence, yet doesn't have the wherewithal to affect it. Mr. Brightside would serve as a double entendre - one side being to hide the jealousy and put on a happy front to the world, but the second would be that he represents the "grass-is-greener" for this girl's relationship. He is Mr. Brightside from her perspective, by providing the "greener" side of her romantic life, but he doesn't enjoy being this tertiary part of her romantic life.
I remember once I was coming up to a green light, the traffic was light and there was a car coming the opposite direction. They were turning left, and I thought probably not the best time to turn left but if I slow down a little they can make it. All of a sudden the guy makes a U-Turn in the intersection. I have to slam on the brakes and avoid hitting him by about three feet. Such stupidity can not be tolerated.
Avocado is mostly because of the pit. Unless they eat like 6, the actual green won't hurt them.
Most recently I ate some dried pineapple, but I don't know if you would consider that a meal. Before that, I ate hot cocoa, fruit snacks, and fruit and grain bars. I ate a lot of those, but if you still wouldn't consider that a meal, then before that I had Kraft macaroni and shrimp and green tea with sugar.
I had a green Malibu when I was first driving that my friends nick named the "Snot Rocket" . 20 years later I just bought a brand new Jeep Cherokee that is also green so I decided to name it the "Snot Rocket 2"

I *like* the green apple ones :(
Today, as a pedestrian crossing on a walk signal, I had a bus honk at me because they had a green light and wanted to turn right but I was in their way. The bus wasn't even in service.
My biggest problems are large unremovable ads (wikia has ones that cover ‚Öì of my screen, no joke) and those ones for that pdf converter thing that have the big green DOWNLOAD button. It should be illegal to trick a person into downloading a virus like that.
Way to skip over the other point.   1. Those laws might exists where you're from, but they don't where I am. 2. Again, the dividing line should probably still be incest laws. Men may not be able to procreate, but incest laws [and yes, it's still incest between male family members] still exist for the aforementioned reasons, just like laws against greencard marriages. The question I would ask to you is why should you exclude non-heterosexual couples from marrying?
Two 600mW green lasers.
Tell that to my biker friend. He could probably easily beat the shit out of me. I'm not gonna comment on his neon green fanny pack.
Just some fries with some very spicy chimichurri-alioli dressing and green onion that was absolute top notch. 10/10 would eat everyday.
Where I live, it's basically village - some green - village - some green - village - some green - horrible city - lots of villages - some green. Living here can be, eh... depressing.
From personal experience, the grass is always greener on the other side. You'll get to the other side and the grass will be greener where you came from. That probably doesn't answer your question but you're probably not going to find a solution. Hey, worst case scenario you're single and can go back to hanging with friends. Hang out with your guys. In high school I spent way too much time chasing girls and not enough time with my buddies. I regreted that a lot. Now I'm married and live 1000 miles away from my close friends and all I ever wanna do is drink a few beers with them.
Sneak into news stations and wait for the weather person to get up in front of the green screen then start poking and tickling them, maybe a tackle or two depending upon how big they are (don't want to hurt them just mess with them). To the audience it will look like a ghost is menacing the weather person.
Ooosh, you have some misconceptions there. All through this. 1. Yes, it would be nice to pay off the debt, but how? The only way to do that is to cut spending and live within out means. It's not happening. 2 . There was no time when the top brackets were actually that high. First, those are marginal tax rates, and second, nobody actually paid those rates. 3. You can't just "tax the rich" to pay for everything. First, there aren't enough rich people or rich people's money to go around (the math doesn't work); second, rich people don't hoard their wealth, they have it invested and creating jobs; third, the rich people, faced with these new taxes, would just leave for greener pastures.  Let's be realistic. They aren't going to cut off the social programs. This would be an addition, not a replacement. There are also negative second order effects to this. You know why you don't feed pigeons at the park?
Drinking vodka straight is such a waste. It doesn't taste like anything. I did it a couple of times while I was in Russia, because hey, I was in Russia. Other than that, though, it's always going in something. I'm a fan of green tea and vodka. I never got on the IPA bandwagon. I've had maybe a few that I wouldn't say no to, but I'm not purposefully ordering them at a craft bar.
It's easy to categorize teenagers as reckless drivers (because they have only a few years of driving experience under the hood), but if the teen shows responsible and careful driving skills and does not have the need for speed, he would definitely be more trustworthy of driving a Tesla than a teen who gasses the pedal when the light turns green.

Oh yeah. My wife loves mine. I think I actually have a pic somewhere ([found it](http://i.imgur.com/1lSu2e7.jpg)). Usually they are hazel, but in the correct light they are green as fuck.
Throw in Asian/Korean Chili flakes/powder, finely chopped green onions, toasted sesame seeds and you've pretty much got a dipping sauce that a bunch of Koreans use for things like dumplings to "lettuce wraps".
Its from a movie called the green mile. I recommend you watch it.
The grass is greener, on my side.
Sticking with old people. I saw an elderly gentleman trying to lift some wood back into his SUV that had fallen out in a turn lane. People were just going around him at a dangerous speed and just ignoring the poor guy while his wife sat in the front seat. I pulled over on the opposite side, helped him get his stuff back into the vehicle and secure it properly before waving him off.  Edit: I actually helped a man on Everest with green boots. Wonder how he's doing?
I... uhm... what? You mean like big green hands?
Yep, I hate that too. People want to move over to an open lane but then the light turns green and they don't go. Ultimately they get back over to the kane they were in behind the same car they were originally behind. So you took an open lane and screwed up traffic for the rest of us for no reason at all.
Had people do this when I worked at Walgreens. I was an Assistant Manager. I always responded with honesty: "Well, if people stopped coming on holidays then there would be no incentive for the company to be open on holidays anymore." They never responded. They knew I was being crude and they knew I was 100% right. We're open, and we'll be open again next year, all because they (and others) are there.
1. Extract blood; remove head, hang upside-down in shower, place shower head at upper end (opposite drain) and keep water running slightly so it flushes the blood down the drain. 2. Cut off limbs at the joints, i.e. ankle, knee, hips, shoulder, elbow, wrist. 3. Cut torso into small pieces; might take a bit of time and effort. 4. Dry the parts; place in front of heater, etc. 5. Once dry, grind parts into fine particles. 6. Over the next few weeks, distribute dust carefully and inconspicuously in parks and other green spaces.
"between the ages 5-8" you probably should of clarified that before...now I feel like a paedophile who's just read a greentext xD
Brunette and green? I could work with that. Is it like a stripe or are you split down the middle like one side brunette the other green? I'm totally winging this by the way, I have no idea... But I AM trying :)
Lies my ass. If that's a lie, then the sky is green, and I piss beer and shit magic chocolates. Why don't you do the world a favor and go join the Marines? Oh yeah. You couldn't make the cut. You would be eliminated immediately. To bad your father didn't wear a condom, eh?
I'd start with the Omega Speedmaster Moonwatch with the green bezel. Then I'd start looking into a few Louis Moinet ones. I'd also try track down the Christopher Ward C9 Moonphase. That's one of my grail watches. Within a month of me getting a job where I could actually afford to pick one up, they stopped selling them and I was devastated.
We also "knew" about Pearl Harbor, dude. Mistakes happen, and *no* intel's accuracy is guaranteed. The CIA (I assume you don't mean the FBI or the NSA) fucked up, and they fucked up big, but I frankly don't think it's impossible to understand *how* they fucked up. They certainly didn't just *decide* to give someone the green light to blow shit up in the US.
If I was green I would die.
Sorta. There was a girl I used to work with that was the definition is weirdness. Different view of everything, hell she had green hair lol. She also liked to play with dead things(think killing insects and posing them around miniature dinner tables). She was a strange one but honestly her weirdness was one of most attractive parts of her. She definitely marched to the beat of a different drum than most people lol. She had a serious boyfriend though so I never pursued it.
For the one in your example I would just squish it down with my hand until it's more manageable. Plus I'd remove whatever that green stuff is at the top, maybe replace it with bacon, (and get rid of the tomato, but that's just me).
I can only eat a few vegetables, for both taste and texture. Raw carrots are fine because they are sweet and crunchy but cooked carrots are not sweet, taste like dirt, and are mushy. Tomatoes are great in things like salsa, spaghetti sauce, or pizza sauce, but I can't eat raw tomatoes, the taste and texture is very unpleasant. Cooked onions and cooked bell peppers are delicious, but I can't eat them raw. All green leafy vegetables are fucking horrible, it's all bitter and tastes like a fucking leaf. Corn is usually pretty good but nutritionally it's more of a starch than a vegetable. I tried for years to eat more vegetables because I hate being a picky eater, but most vegetables are just really unpleasant to eat. So I just take a multivitamin and eat fiber rich cereal. All the good stuff from vegetables without having to actually eat vegetables.
Sooo, I can't be the only one who really wants to know what happened with the guy right? An SO who will text *your* Mom and laugh at/with you doing stupid shit is a huge green flag for me.
Ginger hair AND green eyes
YES! Now ladies, please listen. Just because he *would* fuck you DOES NOT MEAN he's waiting in the wings to do so! With the vast majority of us, we have the "if it happens, it happens" mindset. If sex never comes up, there's NO reason to end a perfectly good friendship because he totally would if you gave him the green light.
Playing Mario Kart 64 on the desert/train level. I was in first by a good bit and my buddy behind me gets a green shell. He says "Luke, you've turned off your targeting computer" and fires. About three seconds of hang time later, he hits me. I lost due to a fit of extreme laughter.
Well I could put on my sombrero, a pair of sunglasses with a plastic sombrero glued to it, a suit jacket, a looney tunes tie, a singlet, cargo shorts, bright green socks and a pair of cheap sandals if I really wanted a chuckle out of people
The green apple is also easily the worst in the bunch, it ain't fair man
"mondegreens", the pretentious ass who coined this concept probably felt so clever
I'd buy you a house  I'd buy you furniture for your house Maybe a nice chesterfield or an ottoman Well, I'd buy you a K-Car A nice reliant automobile I'd buy your love I'd build a tree-fort in our yard you could help It wouldn't be that hard  Maybe we could put a little tiny fridge In there somewhere We could just go up there and hang out Like open the fridge and stuff And there'd all be foods laid out for us Like little pre-wrapped sausages and things They have pre-wrapped sausages But they don't have pre-wrapped bacon Well, can you blame them?  Well, I'd buy you a fur a coat But not a real fur coat, that's cruel Well, I'd buy you an exotic pet Yep, like a llama or an emu  Well, I'd buy you John Merrick's remains All them crazy elephant bones  We wouldn't have to walk to the store We'd take a Limousine? cause it costs more  We wouldn't have to eat Kraft dinner But we would eat Kraft dinner Of course we would, we'd just eat more And buy really expensive ketchups with it That's right, all the fanciest Dijon ketchups  Well, I'd buy you a green dress But not a real green dress, that's cruel Well, I'd buy you some art A Picasso or a Garfunkel Well, I'd buy you a monkey Haven't you always wanted a monkey?
France isn't using green energy completely but it runs mostly on nuclear energy which i think should really be the temporary switch from fossil fuels. Just until we advance green energy sources far enough that it's completely reliable
Started dating a woman in PA while there for work. Had to pick up a prescription from Walgreens the morning of her store opening. Was told it would be 30-45 minutes wait, so I went across the street to Barnes and Noble for food and Wifi. The guy at the counter commented on my name badge. ‚ÄòHey, my fianc√© works for them! She‚Äôs opening a new store today.‚Äô ‚ÄòReally? What‚Äôs her name?‚Äô
Get one of those big green bins, make a little house in one and just live there

When they can go after a green light.
Jeez man. Sorry to hear it, but also not surprised. The company I'm talking about is Walgreens, although this probably goes on with most big box stores. Good that you recognise it at least.
Kale is great for soups! Because it holds up really well and doesn‚Äôt get slimey like other greens! Love me some Zuppa, too.
Norman Borlaug. The agricultural advances which he developed as part of the green revolution lead and for which he won the Nobel prize are estimated to have saved over a billion lives. Without them, we wouldn't be able to sustain the current population and countless more people would have died of starvation.
Matrix because green font.
Modern watermelon was our own fault, as was modern corn, bananas, and several vegetables common vegetables (broccoli, cabbage, kale, collard greens, and some others) which are all the same base plant tweaked by us deciding what lived to reproduce or not. Look up artificial selection in agriculture for more info. Right on about all the stuff in the first part though!
The refer to the darkside of the force, because it resembles dark, leafy greens.
There is no greater feeling than having my cruise control at 10-11% over the limit, having someone angrily pass me and blaze past at like 40% over (this happens at all speeds so % is the best I got), the road widens to extra lanes to allow for better traffic flow by the lights, they're stopped, and I cruise by, going exactly the same speed, just as the light turns green
An honest answer is the increased likelihood of a vitamin B12 deficiency, or not having enough calcium, iron, and zinc in their diet. That‚Äôs not to say that it‚Äôs impossible to get these in a vegan diet, but not doing the right research before going green can have a negative impact on proper nutrition.

My chickens eat other chickens. They don't like potatoes or green peppers.
There is such a thing as a job that's "not worth the money." You and he should possibly sit down and take into account the impact this job is having, and the possibilities of alternatives. If there's an end in sight, maybe it's worth staying a bit longer and putting up with the stress. If there isn't, starting over isn't the worst thing that could happen. Not by far. I had an awful job that was beginning to affect my health and mental wellbeing, but it was the best money I had ever made at that time. I chose to quit when it got a (small) step worse, because that was my threshold. My newlywed wife noticed I was stressed the hell out when I came home from work, and waking up dreading going back. We agreed that even if I ended up waiting tables for a while while I went back to community college for night and internet classes, not having to deal with the stress was worth just about any pay cut. Two and a half years and three jobs later (each better than the last), I'm making more money now than I was then, at a job with greater mobility and almost no stress. Don't let yourselves get locked in to a job just because it's the one you have. If it's going to wreck your quality of life for an indefinite period of time with no discernible benefit, there's nothing wrong with seeking greener pastures. Good wishes for you both; this is a rough time, but I share my story to let people know it can always get better. I hope it does for you.

Went to the Mitsuwa market one time, bought a wasabi root (looks like ginger but green), took it to my favorite local sushi place, when I gave it to the elderly Japanese owner, his kindly gentleman eyes lit up. I had a little over half with my sushi, let him keep the rest.
Pepperonis and green peppers, mushrooms, olives, chives.
Fucking literally everything. Everyone's a fucking nazi or a communist or the most evil person ever. A green frog is basically equivalent to a swastika. Chill the fuck out people.
When I was in first grade my teacher cooked scrambled eggs with green food coloring and fried SPAM.
Daily: Kia Forte EX Launch edition, fully loaded. Great mileage and features, low key, and low attention. And the others: *Aston Martin DBS SuperLeggera for the sound and the driving experience. *Morgan Plus 6 for style and cruising *'39 Nash Ambassador 6 in the original green to tool on *And the obligatory Tesla. Because speed.
We got one for Christmas and I throw everything in it that needs to be rinsed. Salad greens? Spin that shit. Canned beans? Rinse and put it in for a power cycle.
Stop signs. Make them all green.
It's the beginning of the Eocene Epoch, the ice age has finally finished and greenhouse gasses are dominating the atmosphere (co2 and methane). I'll spend some time hunting down some humans and hoping that we are genetically compatible so we can start repopulating the planet. I'd introduce agriculture and farm animal domestication. It will be just like a really long camping trip, if I don't get killed by anything.
Saw a green meteor a few months ago, it was pretty wild.
Those are the green yeti you get on level twelve of that Diablo clone. They're just shitty reskinned versions of the level six yeti with the poison buff.
Sprouts. They're small, green, nasty and taste of sweaty bollocks.
Stronger the better. I drink green tea though.
Not hard at all. There are other ways to eat greens.
lmaooooooo are you a godawful cook? cook her romantic dinner or whatever, just call your rice and vegetables a "pomodoro e fagiolini risotto" or a "green delights asian saut√©e" and you're set lmao
Mirrors are generally very slightly green. You'll see this if you reflect two mirrors onto each other.
Thanks :) I feel a bit like an old man in the industry, in my late 20's now and nearly half a decade of experience as an engineer. I see some pretty green grads fresh out of school turning their noses up at all the site work, at having to sleep in shacks or use outhouses... and I tell them that everyone has to do it and that in this industry, people care more about how much mud is on your boots than about how much you know. If you look fresh and shiny, they will never respect you. But the guy with the stained site jeans and the dirty boots, with the wild beard - they know he knows what he's talking about.
In general, a good standard meal consists of a protein (usually meat/fish), a starch (potatoes, pasta, rice, bread), and a veggie (green more often than not). From there the combinations are endless. The two best cooking devices you can own (besides an oven/stove, a good set of pans and basic cooking utensils) are a George Foreman Grill (one with removable plates for easier cleaning) and a smallish Crock Pot. So, one example of a George Foreman meal: - Grill a chicken breast/steak/pork chop on the grill - Microwave (or bake) a baked potato - Microwave or steam some broccoli This takes a total of 15 minutes if that to put together (unless you bake the potato, but you can do something else while it cooks). One example of a Crock Pot meal: In the morning, put in: - a chicken breast - a cut up potato (peel on) - chopped onions (to taste) - some (frozen) peas - salt and pepper to taste (usu. 4 shakes of the prior, one of the latter) - enough water so you can see it just below the items on the top. Set it to the lower cooking setting (not "warm"), and when you get home, it's dinner.  *The Good Housekeeping Illustrated Cookbook* is the perfect cookbook for a single person. It walks you through cooking literally anything, and probably the only one you'll ever need.
Take slices of bacon and weave into a lattice square. Place on a broiler pan. Do another one because bacon. Broil until crispy. Remove onto paper towels to dry a bit. No not like that, use tongs stupid, that shit is hot! Fry an egg over easy. Finely chop a green onion. Slice and lightly toast a kaiser roll. Load that fucker up with a bacon lattice, lettuce, sliced beefsteak tomato, another bacon lattice, and finally the egg. Season that egg with some pepper, and break the yolk so it soaks into the sandwich. Sprinkle with green onion. Put kaiser roll top on, roll up your sleeves, and dig into that shit like Charlie Sheen on a fresh bag of coke. Bacon, egg, lettuce, tomato, green onion, that's five. You're goddam welcome.
its basically the same thing as trying to turn left at a green light without an arrow. You have to just sit and check traffic to make sure its alright to turn.
Hoisin chicken and green bean stirfry.
Butter, dark and leafy greens of some sort, and meat (either ground beef, chicken, or both). Oh, and bacon.
Nah, I'll give you a hint though. 1/3 green only, and farther north
In Frankfurt everyone "jaywalks." I always read these comments by foreigners about how Germans always wait for green etc. but I honestly never see that unless there are children around (nur bei gr√ºn, der Kinder wegen √ú)
Given that all men are supposedly one green-light away from having sex with every female they know socially, does that mean I'm in a couple dozen friend zones? Huh.
Dumb kings play chess on funny green squares?
I worry with this comment, you might be(and a lot of other Europeans too) underestimating cultural differences between states, and even differences with the local culture of cities as well(i.e. how in Chicago there are food items that aren't often served outside of the Chicago area, i.e. italian beef sandwiches, giardiniera(sp?)). Yes there are things similar in all states(i.e. language, pop culture/music/movies), but there are little differences such as in Louisiana(although it is declining in use), Louisiana/Creole French is still spoken in some areas at least among the older population. And colleges and schools in that state, still teach how to speak that version of French. Also in some states, there is local lingo not used in other areas at all. And of course, that local foods that may be very popular in one state, that people in other states may be less aware of(i.e. any food items with green chile in New Mexico). If you ever travel to different parts of the US on a trip yourself, and not only stick to one part of the country, you would start to appreciate yourself that are differences between different parts of the US.
Change the timing of traffic lights - not a lot, just by a random +/- 1 second every now and then, so every time you drive a well known route, and you subconsciously know when it's going to turn green, it'll go just one second later or earlier, so you're always caught off guard.
I was waaay too ill to get hungry. They were pumping the (decaying) contents of my stomach out of my nose. I threw up anything I tried to eat. I totally lost my appetite. I don't even remember the urge to eat. I lolled around in bed (and not the good kind of lol), looking distinctly green. The only thing I really experienced was pain or the oblivion of sleep. But even that was a struggle thanks to Nigel, the pain, the discomfort and the feeling of being seriously ill.
She's a big green mother alright. Sorry about your plant though. Are you okay? I'm going through some stuff lately as well, but I'm always open to talk.
sage green
Define progressive. You've got Democrats, green party, libertarians, etc.
Totally agree with everyone on the whole batteries being shit side of things, but there are alternatives such as USB charging. My watch, bike lights, and a few other gadgets all have USB charging. Normal throwaway batteries are a waste of money, companies need to start building devices with proper internal batteries. Plus, it's a little bit greener which is always better.
Who in Gods green earth would name their kid JDE173901? Haha!
pound of deep fried mushrooms, a backstrap venison steak, a baked potato with sour cream, butter, green onions and bacon. For dessert, Baked Alaska. I'd probably like a glass of 40 year old Bowmore scotch.
For starters, I'd say using the term "green flag". Never heard that before in my life.
Yeah.. Rickert is right there, right? The leeches on the ground on the bottom of blight town drop green shards.
What‚Äôs that one green guy that looks like the booger from ghost busters but hotter? Oh yea that‚Äôs his name ^shrek^
I coast all the way to light and come to a complete stop. The light turns green just as I stop. Rage mode
70/30 odds are there is a hot to trot chick in in his religious group who is giving him the the green flag.
And green jello. Can't forget the green jello.
Yea CBS greenlit the last season truncated for the fans to finish out the story. It was a good mercy kill of theirs, but the writers had to cram their conclusion into 12 episodes (?) instead of the usual.

My fianc√© has the same green striped scarf, but hers has a cigarette burn in it.
Because mint is a leaf and leaves are green.
Lol, /r/greendawn Edit: Over.
I just go when the light that I'm facing turns green.
This guy uses greengrocer's (unnecessary) apostrophes.

"The grass isn't greener on the other side, it's greener where you water it." This quote made me finally understand that my problem was that I wasn't investing enough in my relationships, classes, and other domains of my life. Instead of whining about how easier everyone else had it, I started "watering" my own life and am much prouder of the result.
The green one.
I love cities with some green (I mean trees,grass,bushes) it looks great next to the street to have some green areas and that makes me happy when I can walk trough the towns like that.
That I would probably eat green eggs and ham if they werent all moldy
Tea. We must have 50 or so kinds in the pantry. From the dark smoky Lapsang Souchong to light green to chrysanthemum, I make a pot (40-48 oz) of tea almost every day.
Greenland isn't green. I've heard it was named that to attract settlers. Greenland is in the northern hemisphere. Greenland is a relatively large country. Fezzik (sp?) was found by Vizinni (sp?) while he was unemployed in Greenland. Greenland has Fjords.
Maybe yours but here they aren't. The pedestrian lights literally never turn green if you don't hit them here
Was about to fight 5 guys on acid trying to rob me for a non-existent thc wax pen with one other person. The cop was waiting for the green light at the entrance of the plaza and he could just pull up if he only looked left. But we all dipped before he noticed anything.
I'm not sure I agree the media is leaning right, but that's a separate discussion. Why aren't there Christians getting arrested for protesting? It's always athiests. If there are lots of left wing Christians, where are they? They're not at protests. They're not working with green peace. They're not working with groups for social healthcare. They're not with groups working to establish equal pay or equal rights. The only times I see Christians working towards the betterment of society is via soup kitchens and woman's shelters. Even then, you're somewhat forced indoctrinated. Even the Sikh, which are a much smaller group, population wise in the US, are always out there trying to help. I'll boil it down further, why are Christians so un-Christ-like? I was raised in the church. I have been reprimanded by a decon for having a dirty shirt. A shirt that got dirty when I was fixing the car of an elderly church member, so she could get home. I've been reprimanded for "not tithing" enough, when I was literally on food stamps. I've been called out in the middle of a sermon because I chose to hug a male friend who happened to be gay. I tried church after church, across 6 different counties in 2 different states. Every last one has been judgemental about some things. Even the "biker church" that would do memorial rides for fallen service members rejected me because I didn't have the right kind of motorcycle. So, I've seen the darkness that lurks in the church.
My son specifically asks for the canned green beans and bacon dish my wife makes for Thanksgiving. :)
I've been drinking green tea and go to church on Sunday.
I'm sure you do, everyone has to if they should pass their driving test. but one day you'll merge and forget to use a blinker, one day you'll accidentally cut someone off, one day you might have something else on your mind and wait too long on a green light or mess up the order in a four way stop. then someone else who thinks they can drive like an instructor will tell themselves that you are an idiot who doesn't know how to drive and that 'NO ONE EVER' uses their blinkers. I've driven in the US, in Canada, in south america, and in the middle east. no offense, but if someone in north america complains about 'no body using their blinkers' then I kind of just laugh to myself. in the middle east many driver don't want you to merge, like, they don't want you going ahead of them. because of this many times people don't want to use their blinkers to avoid the person behind them seeing their intentions and cutting them off. that or they feel that just because they put their blinker on they have the right to merge
A failed actor turned greengrocer.
I'll take anyone with a Swedish / dutch / new zealand green card Edit: Guys lower your flagpoles, I'm just a very handsome, funny, smart, and caring dude from England. If anyone knows Taylor Momsen tell her to hit me up.
[Life's Greens](http://www.puritan.com/green-food-057/lifes-greens-with-advanced-probiotic-formula-005225). Love that stuff!
The grass is never greener on the underside.
You're not taking into account how other people think about it. For example, I disagree with you about the carbon emissions having any negative effect at all. So to me, you're ignoring an easy solution to push a political agenda.  Out of step in exaggerated scope and out of step for the reasons to ban plastic products. Littering problems are claimed as the issue in a campaign to curb usage or politically ban, then you turn around and will claim it is all about emissions. It's a bait and switch argument and it's out of step with people. It comes off as dishonesty (because it is dishonest).  Correct. But they do [*green the planet*.](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/carbon-dioxide-fertilization-greening-earth) Something that I support.
It depends on how much I've drunk. As a typical rule by the time I'm singing Lambs on the green hill its time to go home.
Collard greens. Yes, they're delicious. But it's like a colon cleanse. You won't need any more before what's in the fridge goes bad.
Draw a nice, hot bath. Burn a little incense (green tea or lavender). Play a little Rachel Price on the iPod. Pour a drink. Soak in tub, listening to jazz and sipping drink until drink is gone or the water is cold.
Most delicious 'home made' food isn't hard or time consuming to prepare. Typically its completely the opposite, either it cooks very quickly (like tacos, stir fry, grilled cheese, hamburgers, etc) or it just needs to be left alone in a pot to turn into something glorious (chili, pot roast, corned beef, gumbo, etc). My experience has always been that most dishes require far more patience than effort. The only time its the opposite is if you are trying to get 3+ dishes to all be servable at the same time, that takes some actual experience but still isn't that hard. Even back in the old days, when everything was cooked at home, everyone was still plenty busy with the thousands of other things that needed to get done and couldn't, and didn't, devote themselves to hours of drudgery just to prepare food. Get a cookbook with skillet dishes (stir fry, hamburgers, omeletes, brats), crock pot dishes (pot roast, chicken/beef/etc with noodles, chili, pork and beans), soups (gumbo, posole, vegetable soup), and casseroles (mac and cheese, scalloped potatoes, green been casserole), and you'll spend 10-20 minutes preparing and then minutes of cooking, or hours of just waiting that you can spend doing something else.

I taught myself how to be decent with VFX such as green screens for personal video editing projects which spun into understanding how to edit logos/designs with a video editing program by exporting in a single frame &amp; this last semester I designed 4 shirts for my university club. Thing is, this has nothing to do with my major at all whatsoever &amp; picked up all this knowledge for fun/as a hobby
Fck that guy in green mile
The glacial right turn when there is plenty of room to turn, the light is green (or there's no traffic), and there's no one else in the car who needs the car to turn at under 1 mile per hour. I can see being cautious on a left turn, but a clear right turn you don't even need to slow down that much.
'Look at the green light here sir.' 'I am' 'Sir, I can see your eye, you're looking left.' Every time.
I eat my meals sequentially, i.e. I'll eat all of one thing before moving onto the next thing. At Thanksgiving, I'll eat all the turkey, then all the mashed potatoes, then all the green bean casserole, and so forth. I've gotten a bit better with it as I've gotten older, but I have no idea why I do this. It's not something I feel compelled to do, it's just how I've usually eaten.
Yes!! I moved to Ca from NY and wanted to smoke a blunt one day. No dutches. I eventually found some at Walgreens.
When the car behind you honks 0.001 milliseconds right after the traffic light you're both waiting on turns green. That shit infuriates me. Truck and bus drivers specially do this. Its like in their training or something.
It's from greenland.  It probably doesn't see a whole lot of humans.
Dark green, more specifically an emerald green. Im a nature person, I love the forest.
I‚Äôm on the cusp of Virgo and Leo so I cherry pick the parts I like. Hate my birthstone. Snot green hunk of glass.
This is, 100% a flat out lie. Should Tom be ashamed that his drinking problem ruined his marriage? Should Rob be ashamed that he's a 38 year old, unemployed man-child who still lives at home? So... should Mike be ashamed that he fucks his dog? Should Michelle be ashamed that she lets her dog fuck her? Should Mary be ashamed that she gets off to pictures of her 1st grade students? Should Anthony be ashamed that every day, when his roommate goes to work, he sneaks into her room and sniffs her underwear? You think people should feel bad for their fucked up life choices just like thegreendooooom thinks fat people should feel bad about theirs.
I would hide a green rain poncho under my tee shirt and when I was out of sight I'd put it on and sit next to a pile of trash bags and everyone would just walk past me. Got to the point where they'd just give up looking for me and go home then I'd pop up and tell them that they suck at hide and seek.
My aunt is 100% convinced we're decedents from aliens. She also had a screaming match with me over whether the earth was going to "end" over that whole Aztec calendar bollocks. Still hasn't apologized to me. Bitch. I believe in aliens 100%, but not in the stereotypical "green man" way with the big eyes etc. I also believe we're limiting our chances of finding ANY alien species by just focusing on planets that have water and oxygen. Just because species on Earth need water and oxygen for life doesn't mean alien species do.
Right. I have 4 or 5 cigarettes a week, but drink water and green tea. You don't smoke, but take in about 80 grams of processed sugar from soda a day. Which leads to a risk of diabetes. But these are all things that are acceptable risks in moderation.
Hey uh.. Mlein97... thats a really nice +4 Mithril sword you have there. And thats a really nice +10 dex mystical pegasus you have. Isn't it Vinnie? _Oh yeah. Very nice._ It would be... a real shame if .. I dunno... your sword were to go... missing? _Oh terrible Micheal. Terrible._ Think of all the time spent grinding to get these magical things. And "whups!" server glitch. Ganked in the greenwald. Random high level bandits beseige you in Brandytowne. _Oh thats aweful Vinnie._ Yeah, all that wasted online time.... well... see Vinnie and I here offer protection, don't we Vinnie? _Oh yeah._ Yeah, protection. For say... $100 a month we could make sure that nothing ever happens to 'Cygnus' here. &lt;pats magical pegasus rump affectionately&gt; Yeah, we wouldn't want anything to happen to ol' Cygnus here.
Hitting all green lights on the way home from work.
OK, so Conan introduced a character called Mr. Body (I think). Mr. Body was wearing a skintight leotard that had all the human organs visible. He was really enthusiastic and had curly fro hair. He then introduced Dead little Joey, who was a hologram. DLJ looked bad and greenish. He was sad that he was dead and started singing a song about it. Conan was disgusted and shut it down.
You can make text green.
TFW you read the comments and your first thought was a green neon light in the shape of a cactus for around $13.
I also heard that it was supposed to be 3 movies but the last 2 never got green-lit so they had to turn 3 scripts into 1 movie.

Bare feet on green grass, especially after a long day of having to wear shoes.

Ninja Gaiden on the first Xbox. Punched the floor so hard My hand swelled up for several days and the bruise turned green
I have 2 stories. I was out in the backyard with my sisters roasting marshmallows. All of the sudden we are surrounded by green light. I spotted a moving singular dot of light and recorded it. Footage has been deleted since it was so crappy. I was in bed. I wasn't sleeping, but I got something like sleep paralysis. All of the sudden I couldn't move my body as freely as I could. My phone stumbled out of my limp hand and I spotted a fucking game of thrones looking ass shadow monster. I tried to get my body to move away from it, but my muscles urged me closer. I got extremely close to it then fell off the bed, regaining my strength and panicking like there was no tomorrow.
/r/deadbedrooms. I refuse to have a partner turn me down from sex. If they start that shit I hit the gym harder and threaten to leave for greener pastures
Mhm. Mines just a fizzy green thing.

Her vestal liv'ry is but sick and green and none but fools do wear it! Cast it off! et cetera
In my country, the United States, 99.99999% of corporate companies treat their store-level (and they like) employees like cattle. In fact, if we cattle have a problem with the way our cattle boss (also treated like cattle, but with a little authority and a lot of expectation to deliver and faithfully administer the dubious company policy) treats the regular cattle, the corporation has a hotline set up to call and get all the information to ultimately be used *against* the low level cattle, because, by design, the higher up on the corporate ladder, the more tricks within company policy you know to use against the subordinates so that you always.. always.. *ALWAYS*.. have the upperhand. Even when they're wrong. I suppose "2nd graders" could be interchanged with "cattle" in this description as well. Walgreens is even one of the more reasonable corporate places to work, in terms of the above, and even *they* rig their policy to never fix problems that they don't feel like fixing, that would otherwise make the workplace more.. oh, what's the word.. human!
My nani has very olive skin but her hair is blond and her eyes are green. Who knows what kind of ancestry my family has!

Really and truly? Enough BHO cannabis extract to keep me stoned until I croak. I tend to have a lot of existential moments right now as it is, but after a pinch of those happy green flowers, death almost sounds like an interesting experience.

I googled my username once and I found a blond women riding a giant green cock.
Plans for today to go visit bowling green university were suddenly shot down last minute.
Oh c'mon, wouldn't you miss Guinness pints, all the green fields and Cadbury chocolate? I went to Portsmouth, great university...
I've been sick all day. Thrown up, had the chills, and been way too hot, all at the same time. Earlier, I felt well enough to hit Walgreens for meds. I asked my brother to come along, to go in for me, and he could get whatever he wanted with my card (along with my meds). He got cookies. He ate them all. I hope he's happy.
i go to a good ramen joint - skinny noodles, chunk of ham, green onions, corn, miso, whatever. fuck, i want miso
This is why you should be smart with your money, invest, and retire early. Or start a business in something you enjoy, after you are financially capable. Count yourself lucky. 9-5 with a business degree? If you get into an investment bank you'll be working 12 hours a day. Sometimes we get so caught up in our own woes that we get "greener pastures syndrome". Slow down a moment and think - what if you didn't have this job? What would you be doing, realistically? Would you rather be doing that? If yes, reconsider your career. If no, carry on and be confident that even if your choices suck, you have made the best choice.
The number one problem as far as greenhouse gases go in fact isn't carbon dioxide. It's methane gas from sewers, landfills, and production of cattle. If we just vented off this methane, we could easily convert it into methanol and use it in gasoline with no conversion of the combustion engine needed.
Do you have your location on for the app? I get multiple surveys a week, typically a day or two after going to the grocery store, walgreens, etc, asking if I'd recently been there/to rate my experience. I've had the app about a year now, and have gotten close to $40.

The green flags are more important. If you don't see them, you're in for a bad time. Brazil is one, also Portugal a bit.
Twink Peaks? I don't believe that ever got past the green door...
Small changes make a difference, not everyone needs to or is expected to go completely green.
Walgreens intern here... Sounds like Walgreens to me.
I dipped Skoal Long Cut Wintergreen from 1984 to 2005. It was a nasty, disgusting habit, and I quit cold turkey on November 17, 2005. Second best decision of my life. Quitting that habit has had a lot of positive impact on my life, and it was one of the single hardest things I've ever done.
Full on dark. the only thing i want to see is the green hue of my alarm.
Probably about the time that Yahoo Answers finally got rid of the old green format.
Ban cyclists on the road. You're a menace, causing more traffic than you're "solving" by going green or whatever bollocks excuse you have. Get a car.
Don't listen to this goddamn commie. Murica is the home of the free and the mother fuckin brave! Greatest damn country on Gods green earth! And if you don't like it you can git ouuut! U-S-A! But seriously tho, what he said.
Just go over to Rockefeller center and stand behind the glass and wave every time the green light goes turns on. They do live broadcasts every day.
My dad died when I was a kid. He had a couple of strokes that were side effects from chemo that he was going through. I'm terrified that his health history and his father's (my paternal grandfather's) prostate and colon cancer will manifest itself in me, or worse, my one day sons. My mom re-married and I love my step-dad, but I'm getting married to the most wonderful girl on the face of God's green earth, and I really want my dad to be there.
Full body: human dissection/anatomy course at uni. Walked into the GAF lab and had our safety introduction, then we opened up the 8 tent-green plastic bags and were told to start removing the skin and underlying fat from their backs to expose the muscle underneath. It's hard to conceptualize how sharp a scalpel is until you accidentally cut half an inch deeper than you expected to. Once you've died, had your head shaved, your eyes and teeth removed (for dentistry and optometry students use), and been preserved with formaldehyde (or whatever equivalent they use), everyone tends to pretty much look the same
Well, I loved broccoli as a kid but I despised asparagus. Until they told me that those green stalk things are baby broccoli. It was weird when I brought that up at a friends house. Or how about when they told me my aunt made steak for dinner... no. It was liver and onions. For 10 years I was convinced the woman couldn't cook a steak.
I got away from my abusive ex who was using me only for a green card.
1 - I was sitting in a left turn lane waiting for the light so we could exit a shopping center. When it turned green and traffic started moving, a jeep 2 cars ahead of me starts turning and his front passenger side tire just pops off and makes a nice leisurely roll to the right of where the jeep stopped. 2 - My parents and I were driving home from visiting a relative in the hospital. It just so happens that this took place on a superbowl sunday, so we stop at a grocery store to buy the usual game day wings, chips, etc. My dad pulls the car up near the door and mom gets out to run in. As we sit there waiting, a man casually walks in front of our car into the store. He is wearing a tight spandex athletic shirt, bike shorts, and sneakers. It is fucking February in the suburbs of Chicago, IL and this dude looks like he going for a stroll down the boardwalk.

Even mortgage doesnt work. There are simply too many properties to buy. Everytime I tried it it resulted me in having to auction something away for cheaper than face value simply because I was strapped for cash. Of course to prevent or get a monopoly you scrounge every last penny, but if its to get a green property when there are 2 others un-bought you should not buy it outright early game.
1000x this. When they add them its kinda like getting thrown into the deepend because the shit could be added on your day off and you have to find someone who knows how to maked it. Like with that X-mas tree frapp. you need to do extra shit like green whip cream, cramel drizzle, candy cranberries and then a strawberry on top. You're gonna toss the damn thing before you get to that extra shit anyways.
My grandmother died in 2008. Before then. I was in a long distance relationship and she was a lie. She wanted to steal my money and get a green card. She told people i was sterile so i called it off. Haha.
The time between the light turning green, and the guy behind you honking his horn.
Only assholes do that, unless the person knows that the cars aren't going to get a green for a while anyway. Making noise while you eat is disgusting.
I'd buy a green dress. Not a real one, obviously. That's cruel.
Ive definitely seen that plenty of times as well. People are just careless sometimes. It doesnt help that lights can be green at the same time as a walk sign is telling them to walk. Still pedestrians need to be more vigilant.
And a green-laced bra doesn't provoke any thoughts?
My garden. I fucked up and had a lot of seed die off this spring. But an experiment I did has got me corn stalks about 3 foot tall already and it's not even the Fourth of July yet! This is in Michigan, so the growing season is short. I'm spending my hours after work expanding out the garden with free composted dirt and mulch from the city. I'm growing hot peppers, green beans, cucumbers, squash, potatoes, carrots and peas. Whoo-Hoo!
But the kid will know it's yours! Don't use the green plug!
Rite Aid, Walgreens, CVS, which one is it?
[This is called a "Mondegreen".](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondegreen?wprov=sfla1)
Lentil stew with green beans. It was kind of "one of those Mondays" and coming home to home-cooked stew...bliss.
The big 3 pharmacies (Walgreens, CVS, Rite Aide) all have this mentality it seems. It seems that they have a ton of coupons and reward systems that it really doesn't matter.. But I really just want to get my meds and be on my way. Instead I'm stuck behind someone trying to get vending machine amount of chocolate bars because it's the special of the week for $0.99 off per 4 bars.
Played tag on the cat walks of an Amtrak power substation. 11,000 volts, 250 amps, we did this for years then there was the incident. Some older kids were playing, one of them touched a green cable and wound up losing 3 limbs, spent 6 months recovering in a hospital but he survived. Never realized how dangerous electricity could be and I shudder thinking about how close we were to those power lines.
If it's 100mw, you will undoubtedly see a green line straight to the owner.

Yeah when I wear a green shirt all the ladies swoon.
You are a slimy, despicable, rat-hearted, green-discharge of a man, aren't you?

I think the majority of people believe climate change is happening. There's only a small vocal group denying the existence of climate change; however, the vast majority of people believe that "we'll be just fine" and thus believe it's not paramount to do anything drastic right now (which is completely necessary at this point if we hope to not cause the next mass extinction) other than "going green."
Not the guy argueing, but I agree that it has. But transitioning to less harmful energy sources is good. I think they just refuse to acknowledge that it's okay to work in a field while it's still dominant and profitable, while the world world's to transition to greener energy.
the mistaking of freedom of equality for the green light to harass people
4? I mean, not four real contending parties. You'll have the two conservative candidates, Trump and whoever, and then the democrat. You'll still have the libertarians and greens and constitutionals and prohibitionists, but they don't really factor in much.
A lot of times, I think the answer to 'what were the producers thinking when they greenlit this?' is 'I know a young actress who would suck a dick to star in this movie.'
I saw UFOs once. Two green lights, dancing about in the sky. I was a kid, swinging on my swing set in the back yard. It was late afternoon.
Looking at current situation, the **For profit** capitalist culture of America, which places money over humanity/(right thing to do) is some how not appealing as much anymore. *The grass is greener* in America thought is waning
I accidentally did this once. There was some dirt on my wheel and when I was stopped at the light I went to rub it of stupidly without thinking and it honked the horn the SECOND the light turned green. I felt really bad. I must have looked like the biggest ass.
looks and tastes like green vomit
I was driving out to my cousins house late in the evening. It had been raining off and on all day. But that evening, lightning was starting to strike. It wasn't too bad of a storm until lighting struck somewhere out in the foothills. It went lightning strike, then a huge green ball of light filling up the sky. Stayed light for a couple seconds, then slowly faded away. I told my cousin about when I got to his house and all he did was ask me if I was high. I know what I saw dammit!
I've hitchhicked from Sydney to Canberra (or the other way) a few times. You'll WILL find a lift, it just takes a little while. Take greentide's advice on board, remember to pack water and avoid Ivan Malat
Still works if it's green glitter.
The only thing I like about Twilight is [Ashely Greene](http://www.google.com/images?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=sobe+greene+ad&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=wi&amp;biw=1275&amp;bih=1085). Edit: photos
What if the salsa has green peppers in it? You think that's ok, no overloading?
Plan out seasonal marketing campaigns for nonprofit fundraising. It consists of convincing my boss (Madam Pennypincher) that marketing is an investment rather than a cost by showing her the same data that shows ROI on my marketing plans is super good (and which is the same data I've used plus the previous season which--shockingly--follows the ROI trend established before); then putting together a seasonal campaign with the funds MP allots; recalculating ROI for the new campaign; buying media time, setting up mailings, etc.; listening to MP complain about the cost; bringing in the sweet sweet green (haven't missed a target yet!); listening to MP ask why we couldn't meet our original target; repeating four times a year. But really, aside from that I love the hell out of my job.
I'm not telling you, yes there's green olives available at a couple places, and why are you asking?
Here in California; quick honk guy/gal. As in lighturnsgreenHONK.
Sounds like heaven tbh - I‚Äôm gonna go home, enjoy a little green, and do just this after work.
Signals aren't any better, every fricken day I'm nearly hit by some asshole making a speedy right turn when I clearly have the walk sign. This intersection even has a sign posted next to their traffic light saying "Yield to pedestrians on green". They can go like any fricken time after I've crossed, they're right turning in the US. To make it better, I'm on my way to class, and the direction they're going is to leave campus. Double whammy, the lot they are coming from is mostly faculty and staff parking, so half the time it's an employee of the school. Whenever I'm almost hit, I literally stop in front of them for 5 seconds and point to the "Yield to pedestrians sign". Once I was ballsy enough to kneel down and tie my shoe in the middle of the road, until the countdown on my cross signal almost stopped.
Ye probably they are not sure if you are another driver who ignores green lights
I was on a putting green the other day, and overheard a mother warning her young child not to run onto the green because the "man will get angry". Yeah, I felt pretty old (and somewhat sad) in that moment considering I was a child little over a decade ago
It's a well known fact that clothes washers and dryers don't last. However, an attempt of trying to make the earth a greener place, I quit using my dryer. Clothes line all the way. Thing has lasted forever!
Chicken and Lentil stew with green beans, potatos, carrots and celery. All cooked in my InstantPot.
SciShow! All their channels are great and hank green is an awesome guy who just published an AMAZING book
My (now ex) wife and I started dating back in high school. I was the only guy she'd ever even been with. Anyway, she always dreamed of being a "booth babe" at comic conventions. Basically just get paid to go to cons. She was never very motivated in anything she did though, so I always had to push her to pursue anything. Whelp, she got her wish and finally started flying all around the country for cons. Unfortunately, she also started getting a lot of attention from other guys on these trips. Why wouldn't she? She was cute, nerdy, and traveling by herself. She developed this "could the grass be greener" mentality that I've heard called "the seven year itch". Google it. So yeah, she started cheating on me after almost 8 years together. I found out so I cheated on her. She got knocked up by one if her side pieces before we could ever try to work anything out and here we are. That was 4 years ago and I couldn't be happier with the result.
See that's a green flag for me. To each their own
So I can get a running start when the light turns green

As someone who grew up and lives in a quaint Irish village with plenty of small pubs (/undertakers/hardware shops/green grocers), its odd to see people raving about it online!
Nope, about as far away as possible, Portland, OR. I do have an amazing aviation museum nearby, which has an SR-71, the hypsersonic drone she came with, the Spruce Goose, a Titan II missle, and a collection of almost 100 aircraft, vehicles, and objects. Plus they now have a water park and are breaking ground on a hotel. Go [HERE](http://www.evergreenmuseum.org) to see what all they have. Most of my stuff I've picked up through luck, coincidence, or searching. The F-15 pieces came from a toxic waste clean-up site my dad was working on. The wiring harness was from a door prize I won at a rocket launch. The visits to Canaveral and Houston were offshoot trips I took during conferences I was attending. A lot of the plans/photos were from a friend of my fathers who used to work for NASA, the signed photos were from aeorspceconventions here over the last few years, the brace was from what amounted to a rummage sale at Boeing, etc etc etc. I would LOVE to get my hands on an insulation tile from the Shuttle, that would be an amazing crown jewel to my collection, I just don't know how to do that yet.
Cauliflower sauteed in bacon fat, add some breadcrumbs to it and add the crumbled bacon and green onions. I hate cauliflower and ate this and couldn't get enough of it.
"I...I was told there would be green! This is just ice. Where is the green?!" "Oh, sorry. You're looking for Iceland."
Self help books have helped me tremendously. Many of them have PDF versions as well. The one that probably helped me the most so far has been "No More Mr. Nice Guy!" by Robert Glover. I would recommend reading up on anything related to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and depression/anxiety. That particular psychological theory lends itself to helping yourself. Other ideas that come to mind are having a consistent sleep schedule, working out, eating more healthy foods, getting plenty of water, drinking green tea, mindfulness mediation, and doing things that make you happy in general. Of course I don't know your specific situation but those are my best suggestions off the top of my head. Feel free to dialogue here. Source: Master's in mental health counseling.
Wait...are you serious? A practical exam, I would understand. Really. "Here's a pile of clothes, you have 10 minutes...get folding!" Even a written exam...I guess. But that would have to be T/F, or at the most multiple guess. How on God's green Earth do you have *essay questions* on how to *fold clothes??*
Haha you're probably right, I remember having this argument with my girlfriend once because we both had green eyes.
Libertarians say a lot of things and have done none of them. They're republicans for hipsters. And the green party hasn't shown me they can get anything done. I'd vote 3rd party in a local race with a good candidate, but there's no way any of them could accomplish anything on the national level yet. But most third party supporters aren't willing to read the news more than once every 4 years.
Raw green beans made me sick twice. Never again. &amp;#x200B; Also got violently ill after eating Boston Market mac &amp; cheese once. Haven't eaten anything from Boston Market in about 20 years.
When the light just turns green and the cunt behind me fucking honks immediately.
Spinach has about the same iron as any other leafy green. One of the first nutritional textbooks misplaced a decimal point, was reprinted all over the world before someone identified the mistake.
Grass is always greener. I wish my parents had paid less attention to me.
I've totally waited for a stop sign to turn green.
The idea has been in my mind for a long time and it feels great to talk about it, because I don't feel like there are a lot of other people I can share it with and I don't often talk to my cousin and her husband who already lives in LA. With regards to family, I have not made any plans, currently I'm single, so everything is open to whatever happens down the line. Parental leave is a million times better here than in America, but I wouldn't know if I would prefer to do that before or after leaving. Depends on what my relationship status is once I finish my studies I suppose. However, I feel it is hard to build a lasting relationship now, because that person might not want to move abroad with me and that is perfectly fine, because I would never force someone to do that and if none of us has a green card, the other person would be unable to start working, which I think would be a larger issue. So on the other side, I think it would also be an option to move there and be single for a while and actively look for significant other that I could settle down with(that would take care for the green card issue as well). I love the benefits that the state gives in Denmark, but I feel like I will be lacking opportunities for my career here. And I think my career would give me plenty of opportunities in terms of cash, to maintain the level of benefits in America, and perhaps even be better of as there is a much smaller taxation. (At least I know that is how things work out for my cousin and husband. As she is at home with their child and not working, and they are better off now than when they lived in Denmark with both of them working and no child.)
ethanol was never intended on being green by any means. It was originally sold as a way of becoming independent of the oil from the middle east but somehow people heard that and though "Oh that must mean it is good for the environment" It then caused food prices to increase by quiet a bit.

It actually came back and now has four endings: the devil's hands are idle playthings (orig 2003), into the wild green yonder (movie 2008), over clockwise (revival 2011 in case the series wasn't renewed by Comedy Central) and Meanwhile... (2013 revival series finale).
There was a bill `&lt;there was a bill&gt;`, the biggest-ass bill you ever did see. Theres a bill on a tear on a dick on a bill on a wart on a frog on a bump on a log in a hole in a bog, and the green grass grows all around and around, and the green grass grows all around.
Walgreens is superior to either imo. Walgreens always has a better selection and better deals. Plus you only get like 3 feet of extra receipts at Walgreens instead of the usual 30.
The green apple skittles.
Murky green
I used to think it was family and happiness until I read Jordan Peterson's 12 Rules for Life, Now I'm convinced it's actually 'satisfaction through a job well done' But a recent John green video poses that the meaning of life may just be 'contended, companionable silence'
The grass is always seems greener on the other side...but usually isn't. Low stress is so underrated. Being a nurse can bring joy in helping people. Having a low stress job is going to be better for your health and the promotion will likely bring more money too, right? Finish nursing school and then decide. You may be able to get part time work or something on the weekends. There are nurses that go to people's houses to administer IV drugs and work a few hours a week. I would be weary of giving up a job where you get 5 weeks vacation and is low stress though.
Sunk a 30+ foot putt for my first birdie ever. It was cold, windy, and heavily overcast. I was the only one on the course. It was a par 3 hole and I landed on the green with a 6-iron, but I was on the opposite side of the cup. I was excited just to get a GIR. I thought, "Hey, I'll knock this putt close and have a good chance for par!" So, I line up, don't give it a lot of thought, and give the ball a decent whack. It's tracking...and tracking...and tracking... By now I'm thinking, "Wow, this is going to be a real nice putt for par!" tracking...tracking...*clunk* The ball falls in the cup. I toss my putter in the air and jump up and down a few times as if I had just won The Masters or something....but, there wasn't a soul around. I've told the story to my friends a few times and I don't think they believe me, especially since I am not a great golfer.
Sure, you got some free condoms from the student union. But do yourself a favor and go buy some lube from the walgreens. If you are going to have sex, wear that condom. Put some lube on your dick under the condom, put some lube on the condom before you put it in someone. It makes the sex more enjoyable than just a dry condom. Also, if you don't have sex with anyone, sex lube is way nicer to beat-off with than jergens.
She played loving me in order to get a green card. I cut things off before things got really serious
I cannot stand the sound of vomiting. My ex and I got high (my first time btw) so she ended up greening out and puking. I, high as fuck, held her hair back while she vomited. High and keeping myself from vomiting from the sound of her vomiting. She later fell asleep sitting up in the bathroom and would not stay awake long enough to move anywhere. I brought her a comfy pad, pillows and a blanket and lay her down on the pad, head to the sideso she doesnt drown if she pukes again. I ended up falling asleep on the couch outside the bathroom.
Deviating too much from the source material is probably my biggest problem with it. Next would be the overuse, IMO, of CGI and greenscreen in comparison to LOTR
A few weeks ago I found a lovely fuzzy button down shirt, I usually wear it over a t-shirt, it is awesome, looks ok in dark green, and is warn and nice. I knew instantly when I saw it in the store that I would get it as a cozy shirt, it will never be used in the office.
I was going to get an Irish Kilt because the wee green jacket is amazing! But because they don't have a tartan pattern no-one seems to bother with them. Then again I'm technically an Ulster-Scot living in Scotland so I suppose I've a decent tie to get a Scottish one.
I mean, yea, that was a bad move but I understand what they were trying to get at. That whole shit that it props up rape culture is just a *liiiiittle* too extreme of a connection and response, IMO. Still, whoever gave that the green light should have more foresight than that. Sorry I don't think that such a large company would endorse rape.
Yes, but new plants will face significant resistance from the population, even from "greens", mostly using Chernobyl as a scare tactic. "Nuclear" became a dirty word because of that (you see how it's conveniently left out of the acronym for MRI, for example). Germany is actually shutting down every nuclear reactor, even though they are nowhere near covering their energy needs with renewables.
But Brassica Prime is green, even the logo is green
america literally gives out green cards for immigrants to come live in USA how is that counts as strict immigration policy i dont get it

A green meteor streak across the entire windshield. Thought I'd imagined it until somebody else said "Holy crap that was cool."
step one: get a degree that qualifies you. step2: how a boatload of money and then some. step three: have a big enough space for the reactor. step four: dont be located in fukushima (just place it away from natural disasters) step five: dont be Iran. step six: build it. step seven: find the nuclear fuel ( i recommend thorium because it's safer and more effective than uranium, (unless you wanna make nukes)) step eight: get protection and limit exposure (so you dont get cancer and poop green with agony). step nine: get personel ( to make sure it doesn't fucking explode) step ten: find a buyer to you extra energy (it was hella expensive to build it in the first place, and also account the money from the personals salary, the safety gear and other expenses) step eleven: make sure to get a license for this shit or else you're in trouble. step twelve: PROFIT!!!!!
Another thing.. A mate from my boarding school.. He had green eyes too  At this time I was 15.. When we used to get holidays due to rain... We would have basically nothing to do.. Can't go out to play because Warden won't let us get sick.. No electricity so basically no TV (which was already only 1.5 hrs a week...  So in the dark I would wake him up.. And shine torch lights into his eyes.. I loved seeing his iris dilate and contract.. 10/10 would recommend others to do it..
Honestly? I flew to the US from the UK. This meant flying over ice (or green) land and coming down over Canada to eventually land in Phoenix. The world got smaller that day.
People who don't creep out into the intersection when making a left turn at a green light (when there's oncoming traffic that also has a green light). This is especially annoying in the area of the midwest that I live in since a lot of the lights don't have left-turn arrows, so people just sit at the stop line for like 3-light cycles.
It's all part of my plan to submerge coastal cities and increase the temperatures until all my enemies are gone. What you call smoking I call producing greenhouse gases.
It's a bit more than just that for us. Like I said, the green pants were part of it, plus your scout belt and socks. So basically Class A, just with a different shirt and no kerchief(which some troops don't even use anymore)
Country in the Northeast is green and densely wooded. Country in Wyoming, not so much. People do feel differently about it
Now that China is facing the extreme consequences of pollution. I think they will find a reliable "green" source of energy with minimum pollution and it will also have very little, if any, effect on global warming.
That's pretty much what network executives do with pilots before greenlighting a show. I know that some shows don't come into their own until a few episodes in, some don't come into their own until a couple of *seasons* in, but the first episode is intended to grab the viewer. It didn't grab STIIP. That's OK.
I failed by speeding thru a school zone and not looking both ways when I went thru a green light.
Surge. Was liquid love back in the 90's and just reintroduced. People are paying a small fortune for the deliciousness in those beautiful green cans.
In which category are the Russian tourists that only wear green and come in tanks?
Not much if it's a majority Labour government. If it's a minority Labour then the greens, SNP and Plaid will put pressure on Labour when it comes to Trident but I doubt they would do anything worse than they say and go to 3 subs instead of 4
What's green and has wheels? Grass. I lied about the wheels.
A green light means that it's *legal* to enter an intersection. It doesn't necessarily mean that it's *safe* to enter.
I'm actually beginning to get to that point now. I'm not as far along as you are, but I'm also twenty. I've held a professional job for almost two years now, am completely self-sufficient, and (only fairly recently) I'm in shape. Don't idolize being single though, grass is always greener, blah blah blah. Enjoy your chick mate.
Creamofjismwithgreenbits. Priceless. I have eaten Cream of ____ many a time in many a casserole growing up. Never once had the courage to find out what's inside.
Not in the level of detail that warrants a real description. "Hot lady with green pants" doesn't qualify
green apple is 0.5% cheaper.
When one becomes a moderator, one is not *always* a moderator. How would I be able to browse and comment normally if that were the case? When you see a green name, that means the person is speaking as a mod. I'm not distinguishing my comments, which means I'm speaking as me, not a mod, so my modding abilities are irrelevant in this conversation
You can see the green grass of +30-50. Yet content to stay where you are? Then what makes the +30-50 so "green", appealing? Don't you WANT it? If you see its better, then what's not prompting you to go and try and get it?
A Star Wars movie that is entirely about Ewoks, perhaps? Or a Toy Story movie about the green aliens?
[This advice from historical fiction writer George Green has helped me](http://ollywrites.blogspot.co.uk/2016/02/george-greens-advice-on-writing.html). Might not be as useful to you if you aren't interested in historical fiction, but there's still some good general tips there.
The fact that Avocado pits don't actually preserve freshness/greenness in Guacamole (and it's more likely that the citrus and spicy shit I put in it does).
I hung out with my sister and her friends at the Uptown bar in Minneapolis (before it moved). Janus Figure was the band that was playing, they were pretty cool. I also dyed my hair green, I went through a punk rock phase. It was also the first time I ever drank booze. Yup...waited until I was actually 21 to drink.
Their green tea ice cream is great. It was available everywhere in Japan before it was widely distributed in the US.
Jungle green Nintendo 64, with controller, and the joystick is still tight in the controller
A friend of mine came with two girls to a bar I was drinking at and when he introduced me to them as a foreigner, one of the girls looked at me funny and said "don't talk to me. I know you only want to get in my panties for the green card, you illegal". I didn't had the heart to tell her that I already had a green card. Plus, she was ugly.
It was one of the saddest things I've seen, so you've been warned. A mom got on the bus with her young son, and immediately said to the people across from her that he gets motion sickness, but she has to go somewhere. Sure enough, after a few blocks the kid turns green, and the mom gracefully pulls out a bag for the kid to puke in. Sadly, she used clear ziplock bags, so his vomit was all too visible as he kept puking into the bag. After he filled one, she zipped it up, put it somewhere in her bags, and pulled out a new one. It just blew my mind she had to cope with a kid who puked this much and this often on public transport that she had a system, but it involved all of us seeing the puke. Poor kid.
An awful lot of external scenes in movies and TV shows are shot on a sound stage these days. Almost every external scene in Ugly Betty was shot indoors (because the show is set in New York filmed in LA), and you'd honestly [never tell.](https://www.geardiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/green-screen-example-2.jpg)
Making your workers wear lime green bow ties is hardly being fair to them.
I know the japanese kana pretty well. I even made a Javascript tool for practicing it, you can find the tool [here](http://green-meklar.cwahi.net/Javascript/Kana.html) (the conversion key is down at the bottom). Kanji is way beyond me, though.
Express real unpopular opinion. It doesnt matter how much better green apple skittles are than lime, the circle jerk will downvote you to hell for it.
all kinds of stuff. mostly his time in the military since he was like a green beret if i remember correctly without googling.
That don't work buddy, go back to /r/greentext
got to love greenhouse extension, your sat reading how some senator is calling climate change rubbish, hover over his name and what you know oil and gas companies are his biggest contributors. Just wish it worked for UK MP's as well
It's a common opinion among women with really large boobs for sure. Must be frustrating, especially with the number of smaller boobed women who seem to envy them (and who bigger boobed women seem to envy). Grass is greener, I guess.
I've heard greenhouse gases are getting better. The way we're progressing, our ozone layer may go back to pre-1980 levels.
Irish Nachos: Waffle fries, cheese, bacon, green onion, jalapenos. Serve with ranch.
Just drink a green fruit rush.
So, I don't really have a life threatning story or anything that cool, but last year my dad and I picked up my sister and her friend from the airport, when we were going home, my dad and I saw a big, flash of green light from the sky. I belived it might of been a metorer of some sort, but then more people would of talked about it and I could find nothing about it. My dad thought it was religion related.
Back when I was dumb, I rented RPGs like pokemon and fire emblem for GBA. I remember my first introduction to swearing was a pokemon leaf green file where all of the caught pokemon in the saved data were named various swears. There was box full of just the N-word too. They weren't all one pokemon either, someone went out on a mission to catch 'em all then named all the n-word.
Though you need to be careful with this map, because some states allow local (county, city level) ordinances to override. California, for example, may show up green in your map, but you don't want to be topless in certain cities who may have specific laws that only apply to their county or city.
Funny thing in UK, you can cross the street pretty much anywhere, as long as it's not a busy street with fast-moving traffic. If it's a residential area, then everyone will slow down, even if they have green light. Police too.
Pepperoni, mushrooms, olives and green peppers.
Green apple is fucking awful. Customers have been trying to get them to go back to lime ever since they did that. I've stopped buying them--not that I bought a lot, but still--until the green apple fiasco is over.
I was driving and stopped at a green light. Needless to say the dude behind me was not happy lmao
As far as caskets go, there's really no reason for many of the options to exist outside of making money though.  What does dirt cost these days? Throw in the cost of adding dirt to the mound every few months until the body is decomposed, I doubt it'll eat much into the difference between a green burial and a full embalming/casket/vault deal.
You will make a great engineer don't worry my friend. A C pagefile will not limit your success in any way. Just buy a copy of the Data Structures and Algorithms textbook and study that shit along with the green book once it's hiring season and you'll be alright.
Or tea. My ex once bought green tea.
This little gem was the first experience with a [roundabout](http://www.shopsatgreenoak.com/roundabouts.html) that people in my area had.

well, we will all be living in domes, starving, with only the enertron to keep us alive after Lavos appears from the earths crusts and rains down fire destroying the pleasant green world we once knew.
having it start all over again, from the point of like someone's who we have never met before's first greensight/dream thing.
Being 15 years younger. What else is there to miss? Not the music. Not the fashions. Not the gigantic cell phones with a screen that could show you as many as 7 different shades of green.
React as fast as you can to green lights. Start accelerating instantly after the light turns green.
I live in Ga, and I have never heard of that :/ what green button?
Both. Coffee before noon, green tea up until dinner, then back to coffee.
I would like to slide my hands up and down your beautiful wallet stroking the glorious leather and removing that creamy green money. Afterwards we can stroll to the ATM and you can push the buttons and unload a fat wad into my pocket. Then cookies, I want cookies.
Magnets. And ghouls. Little green ghouls buddies!
I agreed to be a bridesmen for a friend of mine. I bought the stupid mint green tuxedo and everything before she cancelled the wedding two days before go time. I guess it's better than them getting married and hating each other forever/'til they get a divorce, but I still felt like my time was wasted. And hey, now I have a mint green tuxedo, so I've got that going for me.
Back around 2006 or so, one of the common downloaded freeware software suites had, buried in its typical legalese verbiage, language to the effect of "this contract is binding and we could say the moon is made of green cheese, and you would have to agree to it so read them carefully". I don't remember what software it was but it made me chuckle.
Also, if the engineer gives you a green light, don't necessarily take the lowest bidder. I work in the southern New England construction industry and there are A LOT of bottom feeders that will do a really shitty job and leave you with the repair costs. Roof decks are something that can bite you in the ass hard if they're not done right.

Uh tbh I started with iMovie in middle school because we had a film class there. Teacher just taught us basic stuff like how to cut clips, space them out correctly, and add music. This is what got me interested in editing because I realized how much it can legit break/build a movie. Then I stayed on iMovie learning how to use subtitles from YouTube along with how to sync stuff correctly to beats of music because I liked making montages. Then after a year or so I moved onto Final Cut Pro X which is basically iMovie on steroids. This was very intimidating to look at but the YouTubers helped me once again like FinalCutKing(You may recognize him from his Vine videos because he's amazing at doing/teaching green screen effects), OnlyUseMyTutorials(great for basics of the UI along with how to work with it), &amp; as of now Ryan Nangle(who makes very short tutorials on how to do extremely creative effects/transitions that are a bit difficult to picture starting out so I recommend watching the other two first). OnlyUseMyTutorials actually personally commented on a video I made to let me know how to improve on what I did but said I nailed it &amp; personally enjoyed what I created. This made me wanna keep trying new things/edits on my own YouTube channel, then I realized just this year that I could make images by manipulating a single frame of a video &amp; exporting that single frame. This is what led to me starting Logo work but all my video effects knowledge basically were enough for me to do what I needed. The only difference in mindset is that I'm technically just editing a video that's been paused. Long story short, try out iMovie, learn basic things such as cutting/trimming, figure out how to "sync" footage to music by YouTube tutorials through making something fun like a vacation video or a game montage as I did. Then when you're ready move onto Final Cut Pro X which I admit I pirated lol so there's plenty of "resources" all over google. Especially on YouTube itself if you find the best rated/newest ways to get it for free. The comments section are usually reliable to me in my experience to see if it's legit or not. Sorry this took forever to type but I hope this helped
No, because organic, in many cases, is nothing but greenwashing.
I'm the one weirdo who loves the green apple ones. Just mail them to me, I'll put them to a good home.
Did not expect (a subset of) my choice to be second from the top. Pineapple is amazing. I'd probably add green pepper too.
My roommate, in an attempt to save time in the shower (6 shower heads, 15 guys, 3 minutes to fall into, shower, the muster outside your rooms) put a squirt of his green shampoo on top of his head when we had to fall out on line in the passage way outside of our rooms. The DI asked him if he "enjoyed sucking off the Hulk"
That was one of those things I never thought was that rare until I heard someone say it was, and then I realized I only know 1 other person with green eyes besides myself.
Hitting every single green light on the way to your destination.
What monster switches lime with green apple? I hate green apple candy flavor
I once saw a guy in a Pikachu onesie riding a motorbike at 3am. When the light went green, he raced the guy in the lane next to him. It was pretty cool. I took a photo: https://i.imgur.com/Sfj0G5sh.jpg
Most women put a lot of thought into the smallest pieces of their outfit to the point that I used to not realize how much effort it took to look super adorable all the time. Then I started working on my own fashion sense and took more notice. I'm no expert, so I love complimenting some cute accessories or something and then hearing the whole back story of their outfit. Like this one secretary at work matched her nails with a new necklace (light green stones or something) because her boyfriend got it for their year anniversary. I just had to point it out! Though sometimes I take it a little far like when she caught me alone in the conference room and asked why I wasn't out yet, our company culture would be fine with it! I was like, woah woah, I might sometimes entertain the idea of slipping into a cute dress and some sexy heels and really wish that one of my lady friends would play dress up with me, but let's not jump to conclusions here!
Cauliflower and Brussels sprouts. After about 20 years of refusing to eat either (mom just boiled them and they were both nasty). I met a woman named Susan, she fried both of them in bacon fat with bread crumbs and green onions. She would sprinkle the bacon on after she finished crumbling it and cooking the veggies. Now it's a yearly tradition around Thanksgiving, I have family that is disappointed if we don't make it. Truly delicious and I wish my parents knew the proper way to cook these veggies when I was a kid.
What's green and has wheels? Grass. I lied about the wheels.
I like it! The project has been greenlighted. Get the cast assembled and start production.
Hot decaf green tea. Just hold it and inhale for a bit, and clear out your mind.
Bacon, spicy pepperoni, hamburger, and green peppers.
Emissions regulations made it less of a thing. http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/the_green_lantern/2009/08/whatever_happened_to_acid_rain.html
There is a snail that eats plants for the first 2 weeks of its life and then develops the green leaf pellets in its cells so photosynthesis can take place. The snail is then autotrophic and no longer needs to eat for the rest of its life
Peas! Love those little green balls now!
that i did not hook up with those two hot blondes and that red head.
that im polyamours and that its ok. i grew up in a really red state with a really red family.
that is amanda sydfried. She isn;'t the girl i loved. She looks a lot like her. Why i post her pic. The girl i loved is happy. She was a mixture of people and did not exist in reality. But life happens. She is my eternal rival. the red comet. I don' tknow when i will get over her. But she brings me happiness.
that is exactly my suspicion as well. If I walked into an office with these amenities it would be a huge red flag for me.
that is horrible advice. i think you meant to use the red duck
that is kind of a strange situation for him to be in his late 30s and not work. If he was in his 50s I would assume he just retired early. I would like to know what he does for income just to ensure its not illegal. In my personal experience someone not being employed long term is a sign of mental illness and a huge red flag. I'm a guy btw so sorry for chiming in if you only want female's opinions :)
that it got brain damadge from the lack of sleep. #The right is so red pilled that the blue one doesn't rise it anymore
that last one is so true. I hate when my dog loses his red rocket.
that link is trash and has nothing to do with the red-eyes archetype.
that looks beautiful w/ the red calipers! Are those handpainted or powder coated?
that makes sense. get two end caps and spray paint those red &amp; black and stick those on the PVC - still denote ends and nobody will scrape them up since they are at the end.
that map is wrong north korea is also red
that mofo in the red at the beginning don't give a shit
that name is confirmed is a new card or alternative artwork? i hope red-eyes gets some love
that okc username + 'red flag' = historical humour. aheehee
that one house with the red door
that one is always great another all time favorite: Roses are red Violets are blue Tonight we have sex Because I'm stronger than you
that one is time dependent to be fair. Depends on the ages of the couple and point in their careers. So that's not a red flag until you;ve been together a decent time.
that one red one tho
that or red herring
that or the red trinket tier 3
that outfit is extremely red
that party will do anything to stay in power. its what they do. and i may have a disability. what did obama do about ukraine? send stern letters of oh no please dont. im not sure what stance your trying to take her other then the normal sheeple arguments. Do you want america to be world police man? didnt the dems not want that? Im a middle of the road common sense sorta person. ik whats good and whats not. not being the worlds police man is a good move. america needs to let its allies stand next to us. not behind us. dont be so scared of russia thats the fear mongering that has lead us to this. im not really interested in supporting a 2nd red scare event propagated by click baters. yellow journalism. but maybe thats my learning disability i choose to see both sides and make judgement calls based on facts history of what has past and generally were people and civilization tends to go using trends. . i must have a learning disability.
that red bull/coffee/(anything with caffeine really) had alcohol in it
that red caitlyn actually looked really fucking good.
that red circle tho
that red head..... omg
that red headed kid isn't one to be messed with
that red is caliente!
that red leather box wouldn't happen to be a chinese chess set would it? looks very familiar.
that red riding hood pick is fricken sweet
that red streak absolutely looks like a cartoony smile to me. I want to give it a hug while it bites me to death and plants its young in my corpse
that was a red.
that was how i red it at first
that was pretty accurate. I live in the dark red area it had for me and I live like an hour and a half from one of the cities it listed.
that with just plain (or simple) black pants (with red on the socks instead of black) would be the best in the league. Only a few teams can really pull off BFBS and the Falcons haven't taken advantage of that.
that would be awesome if they do. i can see myself buying the silver and red bumper just to change it up
that would explain what the red thing is.
that would have made it difficult for Robert the red-nosed reindeer to kill A FUCKING DRAGON.
that'd be nice! I'd love one with the black and red jersey for my locking screen
that'll work. add to that red zone TD %
that's a bigger red flag than the one the Soviets used holy shit that man is straightjacket crazy if true
that's a bullshit red herring and you know it
that's a dangerous amount of red
that's a good point. I thought the red glow was from the radiation in the atmosphere but it might just be incense
that's a hell of a side job - it's been said that my eyes turn red when summoning demons (and putting them back down). let's find out.
that's a major red flag alert ouchie
that's a meme path that's what I think. That red is getting fuckin yoinked the second you try to gank with only a blue buff
that's a really soft red card :(
that's a red dick
that's a red dress.
that's a red envelope not a red letter you fuck
that's gonna turn your pee red!
that's him. I saw a vid he put up. He was in a red jumper.
that's how long it took me to give up fighting the first hard dude with 2 red dots and just run past him
that's just a word used to equate what everybody wants with the red menace.
that's like saying Ireland had red because of the UK flag
that's like saying a red haired ginger.
that's my dilemma. everyone wants black and that's not cool. i tried red and it was k (mempo had to ruin it)
that's not creepy but a red flag. This is just the same comment posted in these types of threads.
that's not red alert you homo-phony
that's not rust. The red paint is the primer used by the factories. During the last few months they didn't have much paint left to do real camo painting. So this one was lucky to receive a bit of green at least!
that's red hot! thanks for sharing
that's red panda put some respek on her name
that's the Emperor's own mothersmurfin' truth. the Chief may be beyond human but he *will* get smurfed up and down like a skinny smurfin' red-headed smurfchild just about every time he meets a smurfin' Space Marine.
that's the case everywhere. it doesn't matter if it's a red or blue state; it's always bigger cities that are blue and rural areas that are red.
that's what i'm going to name my first red pipe
that's what you would think. That's what I thought. but nope- it's because of skin pigmentation that it appears blue. deoxygenated blood is really a very deep red.
that's when his eyes turn red and he starts massacring.
that's why it's red
thats a valid. because you're not trying to blend in That bright cherry red car is just as hard to see at night as a black car in my limited experience. (I say limited as you're probably older than me) :P and ewwww hyperstrada. either way. I've noted I get noticed better/easier on my gloss black helmet than I did with matte black tbf bigass gopro that blinks and sena smh10-10 and a warhawk lmao
thats definitely a major red flag. his cousin? thats just too weird
thats fine until someone runs a red light and hits your car possibly killing you.
thats houndoom red and black and that toad is Croagunk poison-type frog
thats how my local farmers market is. 4oz of crushed red peppers 30 cents.
thats nice mines light red
thats not 2 color. that is a lady bug that lost it's shell cover on one wing. the wing itself is clear and the body is green so you can see the red shell is missing on one side.
thats not a red
thats not really how mutation works nor does it explain why their eyes are red
thats not red. more like dark pink.
thats not what red shirt was doing though. he was commiting fraud.
thats red!
thats supposed to be ruby? what about the black hair and red highlights :o
thats the dude with the red hair right.
thats why i think red is the best color for diversity. that color can do it all
thats why you slow down waaay before the red light in hopes it'll turn green before you have to make a full stop
the *only* thing priscilla has over lucius is red-haired morgan.
the Bay Area is hilarious: [https://i.imgur.com/uHCgspu.png](https://i.imgur.com/uHCgspu.png) Only 3 or 4 specks of red total in the entire Bay Area.
the Blue and red thing as we know it is relatively recent (past 20 years). more interesting is that Garfield had 48.3% of the popular vote to Hancock's 48.2%.
the Infernus would actually be fun. but have you seen some of the mods for gta 4? a lot of them of them suck and i can see people makeing similar ones for red dead
the VGA cables for DC have RCA stereo sound cables (white and red)
the anti rust primer color on German tanks was this brownish red rust color. That's supposed to be like that. It was incorporated into a lot of camo patterns so they didn't need an aditional brown color. Examples: - http://ww2live.com/sites/default/files/images/20161901223257.jpg - http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--6qK1y76F80/U8RTBB9Vz0I/AAAAAAAAENM/riSyYwg8zSo/s1600/P1130958.JPG - http://data3.primeportal.net/tanks/john_griffin/jagdpanther/images/jagdpanther_08_of_57.jpg
the beige/red looks good imo.
the best part of this exchange is that it's not just assassin kayn. it's **shadow assassin kayn**. it's such a long title that people either shorten it to SA kayn or they just go red/blue kanye

the entire state is red except for a line that goes from Portland to Eugene. But the vast majority of people live in that line.
the fact he was trying to make this on youtube red says a lot about him

the industry will make what is wanted/ i have different times where i want different things on how i feel. some times i want red heads some times i want to see black women etc etc. Your talking about the facial i understand an can tell you where it comes from. I personally love to cum on women thats just me i dig that but it became popular because it was an industry choice to show how real/ hardcore it is. think of soft porn do you see the cum shot no. The facial is showing that this porn is hardcore an means business.
the infamous red train/cape look. I love that one and capes make me very happy
the internet companies are lobbying aggressively to wear us out. they want to pass this vote while they have a slim chance. it's fucked up that it seems we have this red alert every month or two. it's fucked up that they can lose the vote and just call another one. again and again until they pay enough in lobbying (bribes) or the public gets worn down and stops berating senators.
the irony is that his 'growing out of RP' phase has made him more red pill. he just doesn't recognize it.

the ninja/red mage technique requires only the support skills and ninjutsu. you can use almost any job as the main job and level them with the dragons
the numbers represent how many mines are touching that space. take a look at the bottom right of the OP's screen shot. youll see one red flag surrounded by two 1's and a 2. the red flag is a space the op has correctly guessed as a mine so he right clicked it to put a flag down. notice how that is the ONLY mine touching the 1 spaces. That means that any other adjacent space around a 1 can't be a mine if you already found it. Rinse and repeat about a 100 times.
the one I painted a red X on before adding it to the others.
the one across from the ball park is great because i just get trashed there before watching my red sox thwack the mariners. but they have to have some reason for getting people up to that ale house.
the one with the red peppers is really good
the only argument that could be made for the girl in this case was that throwing a drink at a person only is half way to violence. (I'm assuming it was only the content of the glass which was thrown) That argument was laid out by the red if I remember correctly. After that all she had was insults and ad hominem attacks.
the only good communist is a dead communist. better dead then red.

the original blue when it first came out then the red and gave the blue to my wife. The blue is pretty but I prefer the red on high. If it were a darker blue I might feel differently but when on the nightstand on high the blue is just too much.
the other half is red and blue lasers.
the part about the red filter was dlc.
the point is that the brilliant businessman's losses are so great he hasn't paid a red cent in a decade or two. At that point it's the idiot tax break.
the powder blue works a lot better than the navy because of san diego's climate. props to the chiefs for busting out the red pants too (instead of white). [this is also a great classic red v blue matchup \(not NFL\)](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02395/john-terry_2395163b.jpg)

the red pill
the red pill is explicitly not concerned with social change and only mentions issues insofar as they affect you. the attitude is to thrive in the current environment rather than try to change it. it's also somewhat fatalistic
the red pill is nowhere fucking even **CLOSE** to equality. If you're looking for a sub that actually tries to treat people as equals - check out /r/MensLib
the red pill isnt all she swallowed

the reporters jacket is actually red it just looks orange in the Reddit video
the rhyme only applies to two very specific looking snakes. I‚Äôd be pretty shocked if anyone with a brain used it to determine a snakes deadliness simply if the coloring were red next to black vs red next to yellow lmao.
the rims changed and the red line on the 17 extends into the headlights. probably other random stuff too.
the same applies for top as well. I think this is so that Scuttle + Control Ward in Tribrush doesn't provide too much safety for blue side bot lane and red side top lane.

the signature red and white striped cupola was painted over. If you look closely you can see it.

the truest thing I can say is it is very difficult to say if an economy is doing well. Though if we just use the [dow](https://www.macrotrends.net/2481/stock-market-performance-by-president) Best Trump can say is the economies doing good for a republican. The claim that economic growth precludes impeachment is an absolute red haring. As you can see from the chart I posted Clinton was seeing the best years the American economy has ever seen when he faced impeachment.

the vampires (aka red cross) must be all about bleeding you dry!
the white ones with red dots contained 3-MMC and the orange ones were extremeley high-dosed (up to 331mg MDMA Hcl). - https://saferparty.ch/tl_files/images/download/file/Warnungen_PDF_2017/XTC_3-MeMC_Maerz_2017_Eule.pdf - https://www.saferparty.ch/tl_files/images/download/file/Warnungen_PDF_2017/MDA_Basecamp_August_2017_XTC_extrem_hoch_%20Eule.pdf
the wrapper was plain red? I know popote just means straw in spanish so that's not great for finding a specific candy. Have you tried asking her?
the yellow and red look great with the blue - not my taste by any means but you did a nice job! Glad you decided to do what you liked and that it turned out well!
their parents never gave them enough attention as a child so they do obviously annoying shit in public so all eyes are on them to gain a sense of worth but in reality we're daydreaming of them getting hit by a electric scooter who runs a red light.
their superbowl combo (what you pictured) was the best. when they switched the colours and added navy pants it all went downhill. i think they should use the red (from the logo) more for contrast.
then the solution is clear. you have three choices. pearl white with gold tape. black with red tape. or sell your yamaha and get something else.
then you get a red shirt and get to go on away missions.
there are empty seats in the red section. why do this?
there are many junglers that are red buff dependent so I think he'll be fine
there are more issues affecting gay people than marriage. Ask T_D about trans people in the military or protecting their jobs from discrimination and we'll see that egalitarianism evaporate like a drop of water on red-hot stone.
there are plenty of cheap Australian reds that are about perfect for people who aren't ready for a dry red!!!
there are so many red flags and warnings its crazy. :(
there are thirteen red ones
there is a cool video about how to plastic weld on you tube. all you basically need is a few red lego blocks and some acetone. I tried it on my front bumper and it worked (like magic)
there is a difference between running a red light and treating it like a stop sign if it wont change due to your size.
there is a reason i have not lost a fight. Because i am crazy and see red.
there is a very tenuous link between red meat and heart problems. it's pretty well accepted that overconsumption of sugar leads to diabetes. it's pretty well accepted that smoking leads to emphasema and lung disease. eating meat is something many animals all over earth do. only one processes sugar and tobacco.
there is actually a lot of people with a red and white striped shirts here..
there is debate about the flag in portugal as far as i know. also green next to red with out a coloure to seperate it doesnt realy look great.
there is red paint spread out through the pennisula you can find it in various areas but basically when you put it on it makes the cannibals act in a very passive manner (they will attack if you attack though) and also they will sometimes even worship you.
there is something idiosyncratic about being shushed in large red lettering.
there is still a red one available for 20 $
there is worst thing: Ash /w G36c elephant red dot silecner.
there just needs to be a red cross hiden somewere and it would be perfect
there should be a red one with tiny black spots in a racing stripe pattern and green wheels. watermelon subaru
there was a game years back where a buddy of mine found this D tackle that was like a 86 or something. he red shirted him and he was a 93 as a redshirt freshmen. that guy was a beast.
there was a lone red pixel next to it i needed to delete and it gave me a 12 minute cool down so now i‚Äôm just vibin
there was also a red balloon in one of the shots.
there were 2 nice passes from him in the red white and pink game that turned into blown open layups. hes getting better

there's a lot of red squiggly lines when I paste this comment into Word.
there's a man in the bushes! red team go! red team go!
there's a reason Mr. Rogers sweater is red...
there's a touring event where hundreds of pounds of tomatoes are gathered and everyone chucks them at one another. it's representative of an event similarly that happens in Spain. incredibly fun if you don't mind getting globs of squishy red orbs smacked upside your head.
there's always a story. This one probably started at a bar and finished with a red cheek.
theres a lot of stuff in this pic that raises red flags.
theres a nice canvas you get get from ikea like this for a reasonable price. Theres one in red hook
theres many women youll eventually meet and will be more deserving of your time and effort. i would ditch the current one if i were you. already red flags are showing. doesnt matter who does the chasing. i would detach myself emotionally asap. ive had a couple of similar experiences in the past so thats how i learned from it. i wish you the best of luck.
theres plenty of associations with red meat and diabetes occurrence too that doesn't make it very useful data though
there‚Äôs a difference between racist and conservative. they don‚Äôt represent the entire republican party (clearly because they created a whole new political party) and really this point is an example of red herring.
these covers are fucking amazing. I had to buy the red ones because they were cheapest but I'm going to be getting these as soon as I can. I like the red covers too because of the art style but these are MUCH better.
these games weren't good at all .. big red one is extremtly inferior to cod2 cod3 is a rushed mess waw is a shit attempt at making cod : uo and it doesn't work...
these things fucked my eyes...I have used em all a million times..now my eyes are forever red and no eye drops work...ye be warned
they also are wearing a lot of red. fucking pinkos.
they also have red dead which is believed to be getting released soon on pc so i doubt they give a fuck
they always hit red lights.... ALWAYS!
they are comparable mate stop looking for arguments. If I say an orange is round like an apple am I saying the orange is red?
they are cucked and don't know it yet. They have swallowed a pill thinking it was red. They are merely color blind.
they are the regular yellow and white (and red but you don't need red since NES is mono) cables. you or someone you live with probably has some laying around.
they both wear red so clearly they're on the same team but pretending to fight /s
they can't keep the color correct between green/red everyday at market open all options are priced as one penny for a random amount of time  and you're worried about IV numbers?
they could just try remaking all the cod1 maps each game :P not matter what type of game it is. i mean they already reused them in 2 big red one 3 4 mw2 black ops 3(sort of) and now WW2
they didnt have honeycrisp when i went last time so i had to guess. i went with braeburn. Do not go for braeburn. its just a red delicious with a different name.
they dip the tip of organic bananas in red wax where I live
they do? i mean the guys at school say its red but mum says its strawberry blonde!
they don't have light blue though &amp; it wouldn't be much red.
they don't have the budget for it after their red-beans-and-rice gruel
they dont leave condiments out for you to put how much garlic or red pepper you need? the fuck
they got better beer than just IPA - i'm getting a red!
they have a red football field and a kick as mascot.
they just like red
they kind of do. there are actually pills that have the benificial ingredient of red Wine in them.
they look like [Red Wings in Copper Rough and tough](http://www.shoebuy.com/red-wing-heritage-1907/391753/836155?cm_mmc=googleproductads_pla-_-none-_-none-_-{keyword}) but I'm not seeing the RW logo on the side..
they make good ice cream. In fact most of the world has good ice cream. I love the japanese brand green tea ice cream. I also love the chinese brand red bean ice cream.
they might play warframe and expect to get red crits. god could you imagine? overcapping crit gives a chance to deal 4x damage with an auto?
they never left up here but were branded on box as candy sticks and dont have the bit of red colouring on the tip any more
they should call it a red crab when its cooked then
they threatened to kill and rape her... if the reports are right. Obvious red herring is obvious. Men are not an oppressed minority.
they were sold to me as red claws but I'm not sure. I think the heat mat is a good start
they were used on the last red bull promo video
they wont stop me. jokes on them my dad uncle and myself bought our tickets like 3 months ago. im born an raised in omaha but now live in denver. im gonna wear my red and support my team right in their own yard and they wont stop me. i live behind enemy lines anyway. :)
they're a fucking scam. red flags everywhere.
they're fucking red!!
they're red
they're red actually :p weird light though feel free to pull them all the way down c:
they're the most polished and pro ready of all players. they would also not have any red flags (particularly character issues).
theyre all red Roshes
thigh-highs with high-caliber long-barreled rifles Small red horns The lordosis pose Skintight bodysuits
think about it my red friend. if the team loses a lot to their conference foes then why would people want to go to games or watch the late games vs teams that are cupcakes. ALso since we are husker fans we dont really know what its like to be out of the race for anything and starting 0-3 or anything of that sort. think about that. The moral of the season is gone and then you would just have a bunch of rage people spreading panic and firing people.
think of it as trying to go red in the face basically.
think those are fake. None of the BRED Jordan 1's that I know of have a red tongue tag.
thirded ezblocker. but then i got google music play and went from 11 million songs to 30 million songs for free for four months :) (and the useless youtube red included too!)
this alone makes me want to jump wagon to the red team
this comment gets the red flannel e: I have given myself the red flannel
this explains all the bug pokemon and the huge forest filled with them in the beginning of red/blue
this feels like a red flag to me.
this game has more red flags than the entire Russian nation
this i just do not FE unless i have a history with a vendor and placing a FE listing as non-FE is against agora's rules and can be a red flag
this is a big red flag.
this is a moderate takeover of the party over the red dems.
this is a red flag. It's a controlling move
this is a red state why would we want liberal news?
this is awesome. Love that rainbow selvedge and the prints. ninja edit: those peanut suede bluchers with the red sole are sweet.
this is essentially what's happening. I used to work for a liberal campaign before going back to school so I read up on threehundred eight 3-4 times a day. since the last couple of polls have been putting liberals in second place so a lot of ridings that are tight inontario are showing up red. I mean my riding was traditionally 55-60% liberal and it seems to be a tight race but right now its sitting at 81%
this is hard. i love the red laces. i think im gonna buy some new laces now
this is my normal go to move. red heads are like drugs to me.
this is not that odd. John stewart is like animated batman beyond. He is not hal jordan. Red son superman is not kryptonian. red son Batman is not bruce wayne either.
this is odd because my coworker and i both wear contacts but she is much more sensitive to onions than i am. she can‚Äôt even be around red onions or else her eyes start watering like crazy
this is on tr_walkway which is a map full of bots who just walk in one direction and he probably was on red killing those bots.
this is such uncanny valley. op is the weird red outline from lightroom?
this is what bugs me. alot of people really want to be the persecuted underdog even if it means making up totally unreasonable expectations. &amp;#x200B; No im not hitting you or going to rape you because i said your jacket was nice. sometimes the door is just red.
this is why i play red dead redemption 2
this is why we need a little red speaker with no audio to pop up when the SL is on squad net
this league has been **BY FAR** the hardest and worst map sustain I have had since atlas launched. I am constantly falling out of red tiers. constantly. HOWEVER i'm only about 2 days away from Zana 7 so that should fix things hopefully
this loojs like a red kiwi tbh
this must be why i saw some bro on a skateboard run a red light this morning on pine. he just expects people to make room
this red paperclip
this shade of red said wot m8?
this shit is all over the internet though. its just as bad as the red noses that make all the characters look like they have allergies or a bad head cold.
this show was amazingly ridiculous. I remember never seeing it again after the guy in red armor got a motorcycle. I think they figured they had stretched the realism a bit there.
this sounds like r/relationships to me heh if that's all that's wrong with red pill it can't be as bad as people say it is
this sub started as a meme for christ's sake. it was to mock red pillers. i'm mocking him
this was just a red herring
this was pretty cool i hope they do a red hood arc in the DC movie universe
this whole red flag methodology is retarded. its just a binary system. is he/she a zero or a one? you dont accumulate so called flags until its abitrarily over a threshhold. you should be able to tell pretty quickly whethet she is gf material. wife matetial. mom material etc. if not read some basic human behavior material and healthy reltionship material. its entry level psycholgy.
this would appear to be a red flag of some description.
this would be the red headed step child of your GT collection. it is imperative that you get it.
this. its a pretty big red flag.
thor was originally described as red-headed.
those are hard as hell to find. I wanted the red swoosh but settled for the black swoosh. I got the last pair on a random website and lucked out that the site was legit.
those are pretty quirky here and there but I don't think any huge major red flags. If you are okay with them (it sounds like you are) then there shouldn't be any issues really.
those are red wasp. they hurt but not as bad as a hornet
those big rig roof lights and plastic red horns....
those fleshy red surfaces always remind me of that Hustler cover with the meat grinder
those red marks look like the start of Psoriasis
those red turtle shells will get ya
those rimless red sea AIOs look really nice too.
thoser 2s are gone I got the other colorway though. the white/red colorway
though from my years in boy scouts the few times I met venture scouts they would wear either the green uniform or tan uniform but with green shoulder loops (regular boy scouts wore tan with red loops)
thrift stores. I found a pair of deadstock red AF1's for $30 in mine.
ticks. nothing eats them and they spread disease. Including allergies to red meat.
tl;dr = straight red
tl;dr he has a cherry red stapler
tl;dr little blue spots are cities (dense liberal pop) big red swaths are rural (sparse conservative pop)
to a point that they end up red. I know it could be allergies something I touched I was my hands often. Sometimes my eyes itch like the devil and the only relief is to rub them. Im not sure what to do all this rubbing leaves me exhausted which kind of eye doctor should I see (no pun intended).
to add to your online bit: this release has been way better than RDR and GTAV. i remember trying to ride my horse when red dead released and i was glitching through things and it was literally unplayable. that was like in the first week. GTAV i couldn‚Äôt join a free roam lobby for an entire week. i think they have their shit together. it‚Äôs unfortunate to see people talk shit about something like this in development. i‚Äôm not sure what people expected from a beta lol. more things will continually get added as time goes on. people need to not have their panties in a bunch.
to be fair NaCl burn a very bright red. I just don't know if a regular wood fire would get hot enough. Maybe if you mixed it with powdered charcoal?
to be fair a) it was red with what sort of liked like a green outline b) it was wide open.
to be fair it is red stone
to be fair sanji was right to believe in the red headed hottie
to eat? hell no to mount? hell yes. My buddy found a beautiful rusty red coyote on the side of I40 that he's getting mounted.
to manufacture an October Surprise to rally red voters?
to many. i once stood infront of an trafic light with a street island in the middle. suddely i was on that street island. then it became green. i stodd there realy confused until it turned red because i couldnt comprehend what happened. when i snap my fingers and wish for a weather change it happens in a 1-2 hour phase. its kind of on point 70% of the times it works. but i kind of feel empty after doing it. a couple of years back. i dreamed of something terrible being in my room but i wasnt realy scared. then i woke up compleatly drenched in sweet and run for the window to open it and let light in. then i realised i was still in a dream and got sucked back to the first dream. them i woke up compleatly covered in sweet. after that i went to open the window. then i realised that i wasnt breathing and my heart wasnt beating. i had a bit of panic attack and wanted to scream but then it started beating again and i took a deep breath.
to me red hair increases the sex appeal.
to red? EDIT: Oh yeah congratulations
tobefair this is likely because of the HUGE amount of foot traffic. People who turn right on red rarely check for pedestrians (too busy looking left for oncoming traffic)
today can't be green right? we're gonna go red
tomato slices are red circles. so they're not wrong about the emoji.
tomorrow is the 3rd red day before it resumes it's upward trend.
too much darkness and the red thing is there.im rl worried about luke in the movie dont forget that mark hamill said that he disagrees with anything they've done with his character.
too much red
too red =/
took me all of 15sec to google that shit. Rakia is a type of brandy Chuskopec is a peper roaster. Chervena Chushka is a type of red peper.
totally digging the red lighting. How did you set that up? Just red light bulbs?
totally looks like a red rorschach mask
tough night for the red and white :(
tower builds must have red for harnessed lightning.
traffic =/= a physical impediment. it is possible for an ambulance to get through traffic if it needed to (albeit encumbered). it's not possible to drive through twenty nine anarchist losers chained to concrete barrels. red sox games don't *need* to happen? but *this did?* dude...
traffic cameras are not always redlight cameras. Is there a sign that says it's a red light camera?
true but the black red helmet would be sweet.
trump hater (red text) to a trump supporter (black text)
truthfully I much prefer the buff slug or black and red mad goat over the throwbacks any day. I cant tell if this is gonna get upvoted or downvoted?
try no glasses and fine set of make up (natural colors a decent foundation) with a nice little black or red dress. Should do it. Would like a body shot to see your curves.
try red ones which fit the inner part of the shoe ;)
try to put the sply 350 stripe on the YZY for the red and black and the beluga and try the pattern for all the v1's
tuning in for the first time today... the texans are beating the pats? did i accidentally load red zone from last year????
turn a red one inside out.
turn the blue wall red
two days ago i installed the red alert 2 music mod and it made my gaming experiance so much better. never thought that such a simple modification would make such a difference.
two shorties ordered via amazon from RIDE IT specifically :D heres to hoping they're good! pistnrods uses the ones Im getting. hoping the black and red matches up to my dark indy blue.  now I needa figure out how to black out my rearsets without it looking shitty.
typical prime time red ball bullshit
typical red state. the rich get by with paying nothing and the poor (as well as many city govts) suffer
u been wearing red for a long time. just the wrong logo.
u gotta surf the red tide fam
ugh I look dead in anything that isnt pink or red!
ugh red label haha if i ever drink blended scotch (which is rare) i go with black label. something about red just rubs me the wrong way. single malt scotch is all i buy now
ugh red's is such a pit.
ugh yeah. I forget what video but she's in a video with Freddie W and she's wearing like red Santa lingerie.
ugh! what a load of shit gamesman/womanship is in relationships. just be honest and direct. saves time and a whole lot of wasted thought/wondering/stress. if i think a woman is gaming me like that it\`s a red flag and instant turn off tbh.
uhhh that is clearly a red-breasted merganser duck NOT a loon
uhhh the backs of the pipers on the red sides are turned and the gun is pointing at us
uhhh....Cubans are the only latin american race to go majority red so....
uhhhh yeah. this is new haven after all. we take lefts on red so long as the coast is clear.
uhhhh.... red is the color of passion. It's fitting as fuck. tattoos are often intimidating--- I'm not sure what world you live in.
un-ground red pepper seeds sprinkled on the soil.
unemployment in red states is significantly higher than blue ones
unfortunately for mr riley he may fit the mold of a very awesome human being but hes missing two other ingredents to being a husker coach. its just so deep seated that even if its not talked about we as fans feel it regularly. First off he was not on the radar of the fans when he got hired because he is missing on one of the most important ingredients to being a husker coach and that is ties to us. He is not a husker and we get wary of people who are not huskers. we gave the keys to the house and car to someone who was not on of us an we lost our identity when that happen. we have been lost in the wild pretty much for 15 years til now. We needed someone who is classy and a stand up gentleman but we need someone who also can be tough and get in peoples hearts. i just dont think he had that 2nd bit. And he doesnt play the way huskers want to play. PLay d and run the ball. its simple but it has shown to work. Maybe its out dated and maybe us fans are still reaching for 20 years in the past and thats not a positive? idk/ an BO was not that guy either he may have fire but its not harnessed right. we dont need someone who uses his emotion to look like a mad man on the side lines. Mr Riley may not have been that gritty enough. We like our couches like we like our people here in the sea of red. Tough hardworking and respectful to others and themselves. Id dare you to find a true husker fan here that wouldn't agree to that. I always like Riley myself and think he got a raw deal but when you dont fit the mold of most husker fans theres that disconnect thats hard to bring things back together. We want what worked in the past that made us great. Smash people in the mouth on the ground and play swarming defense. that was not Mikes game. and he is not a husker. Everythings gotta come together. an i hope we finally as fans have found who we where looking for in Frost. come home and lets build this house again together.
unintentional moment of clarity from red blob the anti vaxxer
united states isn't just randomly thrown into the mix when it's highlighted red...
unless it affects a large segment more or less evenly. This is why large companies are in favor of red tape - it generally affects smaller places more than them.
unless it rains... ACTUALLY: If you don't bring your sunscreen you'll be bright red in the end of the weekend. It'll be true to the tifosi.
unless it's last nights yankees/red sox one.
unless they eat red seaweed.
unless you live in NYC. right on red isn't illegal in the rest of the state.
unless your car is already red
unlikely. bjerger is a bigger threat. and if tsm is blue side that means red basically has 2 bans. Amazing can also be targeted with a small pool.
until. [nope](http://i.imgur.com/YHVCj.jpg). but [I](http://i.imgur.com/fehdQ.jpg) will.:) btw new xbox does not red ring anymore either:) why i put old ps3! it [red dots](http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/21/new-xbox-360-has-red-dot-of-death-instead-not-quite/):) at least it can shut itself off before the temp can destroy the chips:) still needs to be fixed.
upvoted because of reddit's semi-creepy obsession with red heads

use the yellow piece to connect the two white long pieces use the slope to connect the two white short pieces then use the two red pieces to connect everything in a symmetric loop
using this charlotte-specific thread to say that her helicopter red carpet entrance was by far the biggest dicked entrance of this mania and the only one truly worthy of the occasion.
usually the 5th in a row I'll put 20 in. (1/32). But for this exorcise we'll say you're looking at the 9th spin - the previous 8 have been red. Are you putting money on black?
valve lapping compound. solder and irons. thread locker red and blue.... So many things. Nice additions.
var colors = document.getElementById('colors'); var options = colors.options; // options is an array if (colors[colors.selectedIndex].value == 'red') { colors.selectedIndex = 1; } That example shows a few of the properties of the options array that should help get you started.

wait.. what does the monitor have to do with it? I had a bad patch cable for my 32x that was missing red and the symptoms were basically the same. Stuff that was supposed to be red showed up as black. Once I replaced that it was a lot better. Also try another set of RCA cables. ah i see the edit now. well shit that is weird.

was actually the red spy.
was going for a walk and saw my shoe was untied so i stopped before i walked across the street to tie it up and a drunk driver was speeding past red lights. i would've been dead had i not stopped to tie my shoes
was gonna comment on his skin too. looks like he went tanning too long. the handle on the hammer feels out of place too. red handle with a blue head
was gonna say it looks like a US map with animal locations like red dead redemption.
was it red light the whole time again? the fuck!?
was that the good ole lvl 1-2 red pot cheese? Im an old bank plank player myself. 3 gold stacking items and then at 30 mins sell those bitches and get like 3 items.
was thinking something a bit more complex like [the one I'm working on](http://i.imgur.com/53kt88x.png) starts in the center and ends in the left most square with the lighter grey block. edit: starts on red ends on blue
was this featured on a TV show of some kind? i remember seeing something like this but the kid (maybe red?) was in his late teens when the show interviewed him in juvie.
was waiting for red sparks and boost at the end
wasn't it a mix of black and red?
wat?! where the fuck is crossing a red ever allowed outside of making room for passing EMTs?!
watch more soccer then. The guy's had 13 red cards in his career which is more than the number of red cards Vinnie Jones earned in his career. Why does every post about Zidanes footballing skills also have to be about extolling his (nonexistent) virtues? Just admire the mans fucking footballing brain. Stop trying to look for a role model in him for non footballing reasons because you'll be very disappointed.
watch some red panda videos. they're quite mischievous :D
watching all the show watchers experience the terror we book readers felt when coming to the red wedding is kinda connecting.
watching all these people get red pilled en masse is so satisfying.

we call it red-arse!
we could go back to [ol' reliable](https://serenesforest.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/mainvisual-p.jpg) but it's looking more like a pile of mashed potatoes with red food coloring than an actual dead horse at this point.
we did an unsanctioned meet at out gym and we just glued white and red construction paper to paint stirrers.
we dont know but there is a red dust its gone now but it seemed to make peoples hearts race *as he says this your heart starts to best faster* we need high class healing to cure it but we used it all on a few that had it first.

we have orange and red frutopia
we haven't red pilled enough people yet. Much more work to do...
we must spread as many red pills as we can in any way that we can. So many people are ready to accept the truth we already live with. MAGA!
we say some with red tape and that looked neat.
we should abandon 3 teams and rally against red. My vote is for blue since it's been last the most.
we use the red light/yellow light system
we will seize the red stone of production comrade.
we're about to have our first red zone snap
we've all met a woman like her before. There is a reason not having female friends is considered a red flag.
weird I did read it as reed and not as red.
weird whenever i snort red sand all i do is slap singularities next to groups of volus so i can laugh at them while they freak the fuck out as they float through the air. fuckin‚Äô smarmy little space jews.
welcome to the GOP! Shall I order your MAGA hat in red or blue?
well 10/10. all red heads get 10s
well I buy red smite as well.
well I don't think cdproject red is stalking op irl
well I wasn't sure if it was right or not so I switched the red thing from 120 to 240....
well at least in this case the red light runner was worse of than the victim
well come to red dit
well done red bull...
well ears turning red could very well happen so less believable more practicality but my mom used this on my little brother fooled him for about 6 years.
well great. I just went to this site via my Carrier IQ equipped Samsung phone. I'm sure red flags just went up somewhere &amp; now *I'm* on a list.
well how hard is it to make a red shirt! edit: JK JK
well i mean can cooks use red wine in their recipes?
well i still want 3 red cards
well id be playing baseball for the red soxs so that be pretty sweet not gonna lie.
well if Elmo didn't want it then Elmo should have been dressed in that sexy red fur
well if it makes you feel better... I was making a left turn in my dads truck with him (ON A GREEN) and some prick in a subaru wanna be tuner car shot down the road at 60+mph (roads a 45mph...) He almost nailed the side of my truck where I was as he took the red light. If I hadnt floored it as hard as I can I probably would be dead....And a cop saw the whole thing. And sat there. Sipping coffee.....I think he actually tagged my dad since our insurance went up by a few bucks (‡≤†N‡≤†)
well if it works then more red! Get those Chucks on and be ready üòÇ
well it's trending on twitter while they were busy shutting down other hashtags today xD Trolling Trump as usual. Glorious. Everybody has been red pilling all day. MAGA
well its red but its not a slushee.
well like Mr. stark you have a decision here he chose a little hot rod red on his gold titanium alloy. you should put some gold titanium alloy on your hot rod red. call it the iron bow
well lying is a bad thing. period. and if its going about an intimate topic like sex that's for sure a red flag imo.
well now i feel like an idiot because that makes much more sense than a weird bendy white posterboard leaning on an unknown red piece of metal
well obviously you missed one of the most important scouting techniques; 'the fact that he had no red flags was a red flag'
well played. Reminds me of working at Home Depot and changing the pigments in the Paint system. Strawberry red or whatever it was called looks an awful lot like blood when it's soaked into paper towels. We discovered that after a small spill and cleaning it up. ended up pranking that night's managers by wrapping a hand in the paper towel going to find him playing like the finger had got cut. It took a while for him to finally accept that it was pretty funny.
well said. i wish the state of man weren't such that people here needed a goddamn script just to seem interesting to the drunk people at a bar. that should be a red flag that something else is totally janked up in your life
well that explains the red and yellow stripes i guess
well that explains the red parts
well there are significantly more red states.
well there are three lights red being on top green being on the bottom. I think you would be able to figure it out quick enough.
well there will be one day in the near future when you won't make it there. Hopefully you will be at a red light when the motor gives.
well we did put red upvotes on the car :)
well yeah cooking a steak well done makes it really dry I like it rare because its juicy and flavorful if you don't like well done but don't like it red you should try medium because its fully cooked but it has a little pink still in it
well.. as of late a typical non blue / red tip m9 owner would probably be happy to get offered 325 pure :/ the op fear is real
welp. Just cut 'red cross' out of my previous comment then
were you from the nebraska cradle and hated people talking about the Big red so much growing up that you left us and switched sides?
wh11... you should play with me red devil :D
what‚Äôs with the red on his pants
what /u/electron-shock said. I wouldn't worry about red flags until you actually meet her. For all you know she could just really have a thing for guys like you and is trying to be as direct about it as possible. Would it be that terrible for a girl to be excited to meet you and not want to play games?  What's the worst that could happen?

what about this game goes for realism? Is it the part where we heal by wrapping our wrists? or is it the red bull. The laser wall? the fact a Kevlar helmet let alone a motorcycle helmet can stop a 7.62 round from dropping you? A police vest can stop a rifle caliber round? I can keep editing this post with more if you like nothing thematically tells me this game goes for realism other then it takes place in a modern day world with real world weapons.

I work with someone who only draws exactly whats been marked in red and never thinks about what it will actually look like when built. He also refuses to use technology beyond 2005.

why is it that you are so blind to reality that you have to claim deceptive video is just a 'red herring' or 'unfairly applied to police wrongdoing' do you know me? then you don't speak for me. just because im being skeptical i get shit on by everyone saying i lick their boots etc. get that testosterone out somewhere else. i am being perfectly reasonable in allowing myself to be skeptical until more evidence is presented. the video starts in a convenient time and I would bet there is more recorded but it was cut off. there's nothing pro-cop about saying this. simply that there is evidence we don't see.

will this game be like TESL no. they wont be as generous. its wizards. i doubt they would give us a big dump of free stuff. they prob will do some like 3 packs and x amount of wild cards. I just would like to see the old sets in the game. hell they could plop it all in and i get nothing and id still be hyped. what i would like to see though is what they did for the starter decks. you load in the old sets and let us play for the decks but theses decks are focused on old mechanics styles and decks. Like Here is Blue Black Energy/ heres red green landfall/ here red white exert etc etc. until thats sorta thing happens though an i wanna play with old stuff i just guess il play magic duels on steam which i have been like crazy these last two weeks.
wine is a _terrible_ binge drinking alcohol I had to call in sick once cause I drank a bottle of red wine by myself and I got so sick I was still in the bathroom when I was supposed to be at work the next morning
wine is very rad - that's how i started the day/night red or white?
wish i had heard this yesterday.... ended up with two shirts that had red finger prints all over the back before i realized how important keeping my fingers clear/clean was! lol
with all those tannins if I had half a bottle of red wine I'd probably be stuck in the bathroom throwing up
with red eyes

wow look at that diversity! Japanese girls with Mexicans! Arab women with asian men! White girls and tall tan spaniard heritage men! red head girl with read head men who only make up 1.8 Percent of the world population! Glad its never one sided! /s
wow red we think the same way.... hahaha
wow that guy lost all the air in his body. Look how his head turns super-red after the moonsault eventhough she didn't get all of it.
wow thats a huge red flag. Cant believe he put a ring on that bitch's finger
wow the cliche of red flags continue
wow you're real serious about this black one on the red toptank thing... or is there an echo in here?
wow... this post has so many red flags. wtf
wow..it *does* look like very challenging terrain.. This would probably also look great in 3D - are there any ressources for 3D Pictures that aren't the green/red or blue/red type?
wowwww. this brings me back to when I had to look in nintendo power for tips on where to find all the red coins.
written for my friend who has blue hair roses are red your hair is blue pornhub is down your Facebook will do I'm ^sorry ^^Dee ^^^I ^^^^love ^^^^^you. Edit: blood gulch blues is also very good.

wtf i just watched a video where he just blows a red light lol this guy is insane.
wut ? yes that's also what I meant. what else can blue and red mean?
ww beats mono red. It has to play around chainwhirler that's about it.
y would he let a red join?
y'all need a red Okie to come down there to be sure? lol
y'all's usernames are amazing. and he goes past the red line slightly.....and he doesnt afaik...but he's asking 2700-3000 with like 15K miles on it I think.....I cringe since its the sticker bike ;3;
ya I've seen it tons of times. Usually if they repaint it with bright colors the red badge can look pretty good.
ya and i liked the cheat that made them all little red wagons or something
ya but pence has got the look and they'll go off of that alone. what they'd call him during the election? the silver fox? imagine pence's headshot looking into the distance on a red background.
ya fam this is a stretch. it's Part IV because there's already parts I-III. and deoxygenated blood is red
ya its my secret red drink shhhhh
yay :) Are you in a red state?
yay another red head
yea I wasn't about to follow him to youtube red for mindfield.
yea Verizon charges $30 extra to add tethering. Foxfi allows it for free and I have been using it for 3 years without getting yelled at by big red so ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
yea bc we keep rolling out the red carpet for our opponent's fans like in this thread
yea but the Browns are red hot! They're 6-7-1!
yea i feel lucky. after it happened i realized i should have used my brakes. i wasnt going fast and was probably going about 4-5 miles an hour but along with the sun i shouldve been going even slower. when i see a red i usually stop pedaling if i dont think i can make the light no matter how far away i am from the intersection.
yea just go with that one! but i would recommend a Nvidia GPU since it has a smaller power draw. you know just to be safe! a least you can always upgrade it! i recommend also getting [these here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004KDO1YO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1). it will help reduce the clutter in there. thats what the red cables in my case are!
yea what the fuck was that? so the red hat is the backup qb calling plays or signaling the deference or something?
yeah $25 is steep. puts it up there with the ultimate deck. my guess is its the cost of the licensing for the steadman artwork + the all red printing on the back
yeah .. It's definitely ND's red headed step-child. add: At least they give it to us on valentines day!!
yeah I mean blue was getting kind of old. It will nice to be red for a while before we are blue again... It's nice to know we are safe from anything changing or getting better! and now a word from your owners... ahem.. I mean corporate sponsors.
yeah I've seen a couple of different therapists in the past. And I finally have a job now with a benefit that would let me see another one. I would like to look into it but that's another 'red flag' for women.
yeah after i looked at it a couple of times the red looks nice.
yeah because the light turns green for all of 5 seconds before it's back to red for 5 minutes
yeah but after you go in red you can go back to the same part so choose red first
yeah but maybe hes stroking a red rocket of sorts so it balances out
yeah but that's kinda a red flag
yeah but that's literally pink (rose) and not red like Ariane's hair. Could've gone with super saiyan god
yeah can somebody add some fucking red circles and arrows so we can see the action here?
yeah completely undiscovered ones still show up. the icon is darker red than the discovered ones.
yeah her two guns and big red hair are the worst. (miss fortune is a league character. i think you mean ms. fortune.)
yeah i should have added your quote to make it clear. I see no reason to make all the lights red. I‚Äôm thinking they don‚Äôt know how the tech works in their area.
yeah it was in [the daily beast article](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/04/25/the-republican-lawmaker-who-secretly-created-reddit-s-women-hating-red-pill.html) though the accounts listed have been deleted.
yeah it's always annoying when 4 people split the XP camp while I'm left to watch the enemy team take a free red buff.
yeah it's close enough. There's a bit of difference but I cant tell if it's the difference in the tone of red or if it's simply because the materials are different. Obviously with the shoe being leather it has more of a shine to it. One's on your head and the other's on your feet so it'll work. you're good.
yeah ive dropped several greens and only 1 red so far :(
yeah just heat it up till its cherry red and then dunk it in oil to cool it rapidly
yeah man I damaged my hearing listening to the red album turned up LOUD in my car. Power trios kick ass but you need a good guitar player to make it work.
yeah mine was shipped in a thick envelope with DO NOT BEND in giant red letters on it. they still stuffed it in the mailbox that it could not fit in instead of door delivery. my diploma was shipped in a cardboard slipcase so it was not possible to bend it but if they hard i would have got them fired for sure.
yeah proud of being a psycho is a huge red flag
yeah red is health
yeah shouldve been a red to be fair
yeah snorlax was hard to beat. the first time i fought red my team was in the 60-65ish of lvl range and pikachu was still a oneshot xD
yeah that's throwing up all the red flags.
yeah thats what I meant by red plates
yeah the Montana era red top gold pants is unbeatable IMO
yeah the blonde psycho alter personality of her once had a red dress in an episode  http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/File:Launch_Red_Dress.jpg
yeah the grande reserve is a bit much. I really love their premiere (the red label one) because its all the good flavors of the blue without the overpowering alcohol funk. Supposedly the blue is better if you age it for a few months.
yeah this is how I feel. The defense is beat to shit and held chicago to a reasonable 17 points with a 2 turnover deficit. They at least have excuses. The offense is healthy and they can't score more than 14 points (8 in garbage time) against the Bears; which a quick google says are ranked 30th. 2 red zone interceptions (one of which is tate's fault). What the hell is the offense's excuse? What fixes this?
yeah those people are dangerous to EVERYBODY. **Everybody** should be pissed at drivers who take it upon themselves to 'correct' someone elses behavior or get revenge **no matter what vehicle you drive/ride** I am in absolutely no way defending the assholes who go out of their way to cause problems. Should cyclists stay in the bike lane? Yes. Does that give you the right to drive as far to the right of your own traffic lane to give the ones crowding the traffic lane a scare? HELL NO. You are playing with someone's life. Get the hell off the road you ass clown. We need to look out for eachother. But cyclists can go a long way towards HELPING drivers look out for you. It starts with not running stops and red lights.
yeah we look like boy scouts with a red sash
yeah we'd only get red haired best boy on the ship in season 2.
yeah yeah and same if the opponent controls pro-red creatures. you‚Äôre right.
yeah you could see the red lights from almost the start of the video
yeah your size 14 converse look like clown shoes. MY size 14 red Nike running shoes look fine and you can't even tell that they're that large.
yeah. The keychains are 2 for ¬£4 with free postage. You can choose from red blue black and brown iirc
yeah.. we were both in our mid 30's and this happened about 3 and a half years ago.. there were so many other red flags that I was aware of but didn't just jump ship immediately... (there were extenuating circumstances I had to take care of first...)
yeah... one of the many red flags
yeah... we work at the entrances. but how can we help sir? *you notice one of the guys eye lids are a bit red and his eyes bloodshot*
yeah....If its actually missing the speedo then that is a massive fuck all red flag that the bike could be a dud and a money gobbler. If its broken/not working....ebay a new speedo and have a shop do it or youtube a tutorial for your specific bike :P
yeh. although i wouldn't suggest anything big sticking out. maybe just a red design on it.
yellow + red = orange red = apples apple = orange PROOF
yellow is sick but black and red is too dope
yep i was looking at that. I think i got the red color down.
yep. Ena is a red dragon and rajaion is a black dragon.
yes Especially in red states
yes I had difficulty remembering that red tends to be darker than white
yes and red pepper or thyme aswell
yes because Im not going to flicker him. Besides doesnt matter that its one land. Turn two I have 5 lands in play and you are all down to 1-0. Thats a million times better then a card that can be stopped by 3 mana in any color besides red. Drop an Iona and I can kill it and move on. Drop Sylvian and the damge is done.
yes but I assumed Shadow was black in american gods until I read he had red hair for the fifth time.
yes but i switched to red zone 2 more weeks as of next monday!
yes but not what you think... neither can see red
yes but red for can get 3 imes as many good ships than blue ca.
yes i have several WD red drives in Raidz
yes im a UofA student so we get 50% of at dominos in edmonton. I've tried to use it in red deer but it didnt work last time i checked. I still think I got a good deal this time. Apparently I saved like $13 with this deal they have.
yes lets keep rolling with the red neck stereotype
yes there are Black conservatives but there something about the way he wrote his post that is setting off the red flags that he's not Black. I wont say too much what it is but once you know to look for it its good about 95% of the time. Its not quite what they say.....more how they say it.
yes! maeng da red with weed feels like some real opiates!
yes. extra point for angry crabtree. also the white and red ones are pretty boss as well.
yesterday left hand on red
yet it wasn't foxnews base that doxxed and threatened violence against highschool kids with a minimum of evidence. It isn't they who are still foaming at the mouth enraged at a red hat and a smile to justify their overreaction. I'm not saying the right isn't brainwashed or dogwhistle trained.. but the massive outpouring of hate comes from the left at least half the time.
yicks. yet another thing for my big red to defend against.
yknow that women can distinguish more ahades of red than men? yeah this magazine is a conspicacy! we aren't allowed to know
yo i'll paint Toxel red and call it Shoutmon
yo you guys allow this on your division??? if we ever buddied up with the falcons against the Bucs fucking Mississippi would run red with the blood of first born children.
you‚Äôre right. bright red eyes haha
you actually cant. Its against the rules to make a post that isnt red you cretin
you ain't all bad. God let the lid stay on those potatoes and red beans n rice
you are 100% right! sometimes ya just need the classic crystal. Whenever I make red beans and rice or gumbo I have to break out the crystal.
you are a vile creature. this better be a shitpost. take my orangish red arroe
you are already red?
you are going to be so adorable when you're 70 years old and have a big red nose (‚óï‚Äø‚óï‚úø)
you are gorgeous! and the red lipstick is just the icing on the cake
you are missing out by not seeing under the red hood
you are responding to me. op will not get orange-red for this response.
you believed his obvious red herring?!
you bought those $5000 ugly red shoes with an antitheft alarm on the top and you dont like them r u freal
you can also use stripper for a killer triumph or red/black seperation
you can break this game extremely easily simply by never saying red light; they'll stop where they're comfortable stopping no matter what.
you can get both games at walmart for the same price. batman that is. also red dead redemption is an amazing game on xbox.
you can heat up a structural steel beam just to red hot and fold it over like a noodle using one finger.
you can just use the regular AV cable. I have the Elgato HD and i frequently stream my GC and Wii using YRW cables. you hook up the audio in the audio connectors and hook the yellow to the red connector on the elgato
you can mute channels to get rid of those red boxes. and some of those can be fixed with better discord. you can hide channels with a plugin.
you can never turn left on a red light unless it is a blinking red light. a blinking red light should be treated like a stop sign. you don't see many blinking red lights though. right turn on red is legal as log as the red is not an arrow. you are not allowed to do right turn on red on an arrow.
you can oneshot people at lvl 2 with red as current rengar... you dont need to be lvl 6 with items.
you can see completely different colors than me but the fact that we all learnt to name certain colors the same way eliminates misunderstandings. your red can be my green but because you call it red and I call it red we can communicate without sounding like idiots explaining what color looks like
you can see the red headed smiling protestor from one of the still shots milling around after too in the extended YouTube video
you can set it up so the ps3 outputs video hdmi and sound through the red white yellow
you can swim in the red sea but should never drink from it
you can tell because of the red sticker on the bumper....
you can tell the ECM is working as the NPCs aren't red/yellow boxing.
you can this style of red dot sight for sale very easily because its popular in airsoft encase you want to buy one though i dont know where you can get one with Russian writing
you can't make much variation in melee weapon because attack speed is limited by the target's hit animation (turn red + knockback) and not your swing speed. If that were removed (and the bow and existing melee weapons balanced in its absence) then you could see a little bit more variation in weapons/melee combat. Don't know why no one has done much with melee weapon reach though.
you clever red bastard
you could always try to use a warp command. thats what i have to do to leave nar shaddaa because red eclipse shit always repeats all the time.
you could use saffron rlcs and use red and green on each team use saffron octane aswell
you don't have to be a red hat to know that cnn is fucking dogshit. people forget they're literally in the pocket of the DNC.
you don't want to know. it's a worthless place [summary of the red pill](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBluePill/comments/24kjtl/effort_post_some_top_hits_from_red_pill/)
you dont go to hooters for the food you go for the girls. Iv been maybe 3 times if that. Foods ok it all about that ladies though. An why would you bring your gf thats like bringing a bull to a china shop and the floor is red. Unless shes ok with checking girls out to.
you forgot the weird black red color scheme background flag where it looks like he swapped out a swastika for one of those german eagle things.
you get a guaranteed red baby funko ranger?
you got it right. If a place touts that as a great perk to working there and has nothing else to say about the culture.....red flag
you got red on you
you got the Bob's Burgers cookbook? That's awesome! I was on the verge of buying it but then I gave up red meat.
you got unlucky. try to bring his influence only towards red maps.
you gotta explode them off while simultaneously turning red
you have really nice green eyes and red hair for a positive
you keep offering excuses for why your SO might be hiding things from you instead of considering that a sudden shift like that (usually accompanied by being less available) is a red flag
you know all that empty space in the middle of the country? The red states? Yeah..
you know lane splitting and filtering is legal in most of the world right? you see pedal bikes go through red lights. do you see motorbikes do that often?
you know things are going well for Orlando when the other team gets a red card.
you know... seeing a dermatologist will let you know what's happening right? it's a doctor that specializes in your damn skin. i'm sure he can take a look and tell you what changes you need to make before any meds are given. Because dermatologist does not equal your daily physician. Source: my brother's face was more red than white for years. dermatologist had him try a few different routines before perscribing him some heavy medical face cream or something like that. cleared up in about 6 months for the most part. though he still has a shitload of scars from it
you live in a red state with low taxes. the majority of americans do not. previously state taxes had been deductible and Trump got rid of that as a dig against real America. you are not the target of his policies.
you look so cute the short brown/red hair is so cute and all those tats are just plain hot
you may be an alcoholic man. You drink every day and can't stop until there's none left. Those are some pretty big red flags :/
you mean cloaked up in red space?
you mean like those cords on a treadmill? that sounds pretty hard to figure out when you dont really have any space to create distance since you are trapped between your seat and steering wheel. maybe some sore of heart rate monitor or something that checks if your eyes start rolling back since I know cameras can already check for red eye.
you mean red salsa barrels?
you mean the red for getting in the refs face (buffon)?
you might want to reconsider that statement. it's a giant red flag.
you misspelled drug war and red lining.
you need some big red flair buddy
you never drink from the red sea..
you obviously haven't played bad company 2 at 5 am and strung out on red bull.
you only have one place to check... you check the people who have a green light and are going straight. people with a green light and turning left or right wouldn't cross you. And you don't have to worry about lefts from the people at a red light across the intersection because left on red is illegal.
you probably didn't recognize him because of the red arm
you probably know better than me though according to the red book thats a $60 penny if I sell it probably wouldn't actually get that though
you put 20 on red. you put 30 on number 0. you now have put 50 on the table. a red number hits. you lose your number 0 bet. you win your red bet. you are paid 40.
you really are the red viper...
you red to mount the wasabi as a drive using s3fs
you running red plates or do the cops up there not care about having a front plate?
you seem to forget that volume in which it delivered. a grande is how much more compared to a single red bull?
you seen the red letter media review of it?
you should also go on amazon and to an asian grocer to experiment with various types of ramen packets. theres a red/black shin ramyun or something one that tastes fucking EXCELLENT. i just cook up a frozen chicken patty till its super crispy and then eat that in there.
you should go as [stuffed animal pants flea](http://www.feelnumb.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/flea-stuffed-animal-pants-red-hot-chili-peppers-bust-a-move.jpg) for halloween
you should lean into this and start wearing suits with red ties all the time and stare at random people while putting gloves on.
you should put a red gummy bear in the womb
you should've seen it with the red haired default  for it was creepy
you shouldn't stigmatize people who see therapists like thatis a 'red flag'
you sir have enormous red balls.
you sound a lot like me. I turn off my A/C (in summer here in Georgia) because it's just too fuel un-economical. Do you keep your drumsticks in the passenger footwell at red lights for Destrage solos too?
you still need a can? red or black or both?
you think 300mg dpg and 4-5 g red vein kratom taken at the same moment would give me a nice trip?
you think the red army could spare the guys a couple boxcars instead of making them live out of their tanks
you think tomorrow is going to open red or green?
you understand that you have to give evidences for either blue or red ?  I'm not just gonna change my opinion because one random guy told me to
you'd also be surprised at the amout of pedestrians who think looking before crossing or red lights are optional.
you'll see the earth devoured by Sol as it goes red giant before you see a galactic train wreck
you're red?
you're silly! red means STOP.... ^^^^democracy
you're so red lmfao no offense
your answer is right at the top of the subreddit in big red letters. why do we have so many of these posts?
your bars are as real as a red banana
your dick gets red and scaly and looks like its going to fall off.
your eyes are telling me you lost your virginity in the red light district
your friend is the kind of guy that passes me with less than 3 feet of space and 20 over the speed limit then awkwardly avoids eye contact while I glare at him at the next red light we get stuck at together.
your guy went down hurt. Which i dont want him to be because i dont enjoy watching players get hurt but i did see a load of red around your downing Robinson.
your lips look bright red (too bright IMO) Just really curious what you look like with none on. Congratulations on losing the weight. It's harder to get over self esteem issues then it is to lose the weight.
your point was that loose control over guns makes for a safer state. your assumptions are wrong. if that were true then red states would be crime free areas.
your red hair is awesome!
your right. red has nidoran male that learns double kick right level 9.
your salty tears are delish. Gotta love you rubes who shit on the people who raise your kids for 12 years of their life lol. Let's red herring the hell out of everything because you don't have a leg to stand on and can't help but make this about the poor oil workers in the field *eyeroll*
your tag is now red like the blood of the innocent snail you shamelessly slaughtered you pig
your white xbox survived this long? no red ring?
yout fb red twi Autocomplete is making me lazy.
youtube red I think also gives you the option for background play on the official app.
youtube red is pretty awesome. Also hulu for an extra fee has no commercials.
yuh extendo draco finna dab yeug red ya set nigga real trap shit o blood nigga
yung lean - red bottom sky
yup Chervena means red... I think.
yup amazon has red switches. for ~$81. so much win :D also going from a shitty $15 dollar keyboard to a 80 ish dollar mechanical.. what can i expect? im asking cause ive NEVER used a mech keyboard.(and yes i do gaming)
yup got 2 gun kills last night! though player count is a bit low. it was 7 (blue) on 13 (red) and it eventually died down to 6v6. and we had 2 guys on our team playing as hawks :| player max i think is 30 or 40 so would be nice to be full!
yup red racers still look stupid.
yup. and the other small red planeswalker that was great for dragon decks
zot zot! I'm hype for UCI's run in this year's march madness!. Probably with Mamadou is that he already has foot problem which is already a red flag
{Snow White with the red hair}
{Snow White with the red hair} had a very similar vibe to reLife
{Snow White with the red hair} was a great little romance anime. It has actual progression in a relationship great characters with growth and lacking in some of those really anime tropes.
{USF} will win in front of a 65k red seats
{snow white with the red hair} is a pretty good one.

~280 warlock (I like using red death) and I'm almost at 4 too. Maybe it's just a warlock thing?
~Nervous~ red cap ~rambles on about nothing in particular~ Edited out redundancy.
~~4~~ 5 years ago I joined the MLP fandom. I was making an OC. I decided to go for a fire motif based off my red hair and slapped the word ultimate in front of it because reasons. Idk.

~~Aren't lag pips supposed to be on the target to hit? Seems like most of your shots shouldn't be hitting...~~ Looking at the wrong lag pip. I thought the red meant they weren't aligned or something though?

~~Don't ever dye your hair. I'm told it does permanent damage to red heads.~~ My apologies. That was rude of me.
~~Granted~~ Done. You can no longer drink red tang though.
~~One of my friends showed me this short demo where you start off in a cubicle sorting red and black folders. Then it starts fucking with you and flying all over the place. What was that called? I'm at another friends house and can't find it through Google for the life of me without knowing the name. My description doesn't satisfy Google.~~ Nvm found it. The Cubicle.
~~Original orcs were and are red. Green orcs are orcs who (or whose ancestors) drank demon blood.~~ What /u/E13ven said.
~~Remember that red sectors appear much more frequently on higher difficulties.~~ Edit (thanks /u/mekloz): Remember that turning off advanced mode will increase the likelihood of a Rebel Stronghold.
~~That would be an Inari gate. Those ones are the classic red and white ones.~~
~~This has sheltered written all over it in red impact text~~ sure go ahead
~~Well to be fair \#EliteDangerous and \#EiteDangerous probably both get a red squiggle in a spell checker.~~ All the in game spelling errors are pretty inexecusable though. :(
~~What a dirty play. 8 jumped on him.~~ ~~Edit: for those downvoting me. I'm assuming your a red wings fan. Imagine if the same thing happened to Datsyuk.~~ Edit: I take it all back
~~Worse part is that red card should have gone to Aurier.~~ Edit: Comment rescinded. I'm just blind.
~~You~~ I don't ever see a ginger with brown eyes. EDIT: Apparently I have only socialized with the 1% of the redheads with non-brown eyes and have not paid attention to the real gingers in the wild. I assure you that my reality with social connections with red head that I cannot ever remember seeing a brown eyed one. Eyes and limbal rings are one of the traits I pay attention to when I meet people. Thank you to all the real brown eyed gingers out there for speaking up towards your existence!!
~~[Ok then almost all of them have seen improvement](https://coinranking.com) recently. There are some that dropped in value but there‚Äôs more green than red. Granted a lot of them aren‚Äôt as good as they were.~~ Never mind it just hit another drop.

It is possible that he fully accepts you are asexual and therefore sees you as 'safe' to talk to much like a woman and her stereotypical gay male friend. I just don't think that is the case. How you have described him is a series of red flags.
